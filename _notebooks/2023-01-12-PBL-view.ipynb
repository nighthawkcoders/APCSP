Google ***Unified Model Language (UML)***, this is a means to describe data.  Make sure attributes between Model and View are consistent in your design.  For instance, if you use Student/Teacher as your initial project there are many things that are inconsistent or incomplete the provided View Notebook and the Model Notebook.\n",

This could lead to different Views depending on Role.   In fact, you may want to have Flask be View for Admin role, or Teacher role.   GitHub pages may only have view for Student role.\n",
