    "## Applying Binary Math - Calculator Hack\n",
    "> Calculators use binary math to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.In a calculator, the binary digits are represented by electronic switches that can be either on or off, corresponding to 1 or 0 respectively. These switches are arranged in groups of eight to form bytes, which are used to represent larger numbers. When a user enters a number into a calculator, the number is converted into binary form and stored in the calculator's memory.To perform an arithmetic operation, the calculator retrieves the numbers from its memory and performs the operation using binary math. \n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, to add the binary numbers 1010 and 1101, the calculator would perform the following steps:\n",
    "> 1. Add the rightmost digits, 0 and 1, which gives a sum of 1.\n",
    "> 2. Move to the next digit to the left and add the digits along with any carry from the previous step. In this case, we have 1 + 0 + 1, which gives a sum of 10. The carry of 1 is then carried over to the next digit.\n",
    "> 3. Repeat step 2 for the remaining digits until all digits have been added.\n",
    "> 4. The result of the addition in this example is the binary number 10111, which is equivalent to the decimal number 23.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similarly, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed using binary math. The algorithms for these operations are based on the same principles as those used in decimal arithmetic, but with binary digits and powers of 2 instead of decimal digits and powers of 10. "
