    "\n",
    "> #### Sass is a preprocessor language that's interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that's used as input by another program. This means when you run Sass code, you're actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser.\n",

On the contrary, Sass allows you to nest your CSS selectors in a manner that aligns with the visual hierarchy of your HTML. Nonetheless, excessive nesting may generate overly qualified CSS, which can be challenging to maintain and is usually considered undesirable.\n",
