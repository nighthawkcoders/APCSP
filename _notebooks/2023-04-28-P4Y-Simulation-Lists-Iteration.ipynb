    "- *Iteration*  - Repitition of a Process <br>\n",
    "- *`For Loop`* - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated <br>\n",
    "- *`While Loop`*  - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met <br>\n",
    "- *Initialization* - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. <br>\n",
    "- *Condition* - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop.\n",
    "- *increment/decrement* - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition.\n",
    "- *Indexing* / *List Index* - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 <br>\n",
    "- *`append`*, *`remove`*, *`pop`* - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. <br>\n",
    "- *Elements [in a list]* - An item in a list. <br>\n",

    "Building a simulation or interaction using lists and iteration in VS Code can be accomplished using a few simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define your data: First, you need to define the data that your simulation will be working with. This could be a list of numbers, a list of strings, or any other type of data that your simulation will be manipulating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write your simulation code: Once you have defined your data, you can start writing the code for your simulation. This code will typically involve iterating over your list of data, performing some operation on each item in the list, and updating the list accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test your simulation: After you have written your simulation code, it is important to test it to make sure it is working as expected. You can do this by running your code and checking the output to see if it matches what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Refine your simulation: Once you have tested your simulation, you may need to refine it based on the results. This could involve tweaking the code to make it more efficient, adding new features, or fixing any bugs that you have discovered.\n",

    "- In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order\n",
