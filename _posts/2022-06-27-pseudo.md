Iteration n times     |	REPEAT n TIMES      | for i in range(n): | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration n times
Iteration expression  | REPEAT UNTIL (expression) |	while expression: |  Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration while expression is true
List Assignment | list ← [expression1, expression2, expression3] | list = [expression1, expression2, expression3] | Assigns 3 values to list.
First index in List     |	list[1] | list[0] | Access the 1st element in the list[]
