# Our Plan
- Aaron and Trent are going to lead our lesson plans. Kaylee and Sanika will work on the backend code for the final Night at the Museum Project and Aaron and Trent will use that code to build their lesson plan. Mani and Jiya are working on Frontend but we will all review and edit the lessons. 
- This week we plan on finishing the fetching, Github page setup, and pandas lesson.
