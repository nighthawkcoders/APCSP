## Overview
Teach about lists and dictionaries. 

## Subtopics on the lesson
Data Structures including List, Dictionaries, 2D arrays and Iteration (Big Idea 3). Teach these concepts by visualization.
- Building Simulation/Interaction using Lists and Iteration
- Storing List and Dictionary content in Databases

## Lesson Plans
Doing two lessons on what lists and dictionaries are and how to use them in databases. 
- Talk about vocabulary used throughout the lesson, Code segments to run and debug
- Create lists and dictionaries
- Show simulations

## Plans for Hacks
- Create a list and a dictionary and compare the two. 

## Grading
- 0.2 for notes on the lesson
- 0.3 for the creation of the list
- 0.3 for the creation of the dictionary
- 0.1 for the comparison
- Extra 0.1 for creating a dictionary/list, iterating through it with a use inputed value, and giving an output which is dependent on the input (similar to the playlist maker)
