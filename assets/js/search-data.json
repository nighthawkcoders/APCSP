Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: . Please write a few sentences answering the essential question, &quot;What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application?&quot; . - . Endpoints . What are endpoints and how do we use them to transfer data from one part of the internet to another? . Backend: . The backend creates endpoints that are used to edit the properties of the database constructed by the model. | ___GET_, _PUT___, _POST___, and _DELETE___ methods are used in order to define HTTP endpoints in the API. These endpoints are based on requests that can be made to __ the database. | Variables defined in the __ file are used to call data from the database in order to be manipulated. | . | . Methods in Backend Example . Modules are being imported with specified classes which are used later in the program. Blueprint: used to organize route__ and functions | request: used to access data sent to the Flask app. through the HTTP request | Api: creates a Flask instance that handles requests | Resource: this allows for the definition of custom HTTP requests | reqparse: used to parse__ (sort and search) and validate data that is requested | . | The blueprint and api are then defined as variables and are used to store any future data__ that is requested. | Some preliminary functions, such as find_by_username, are created to be used later in the API code, allowing for progamatic access to__ code. In this case, these functions are used to search through the database to find specific usernames. | . | . from flask import Blueprint, request from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse # setting variables used to store future data leaderboard_bp = Blueprint(&quot;leaderboards&quot;, __name__) leaderboard_api = Api(leaderboard_bp) # pre-made function created to search for usernames, allows for simplified program def find_by_username(username): users = Leaderboard.query.filter_by(_username=username).all() return users[0] . GET Method . This method is used to __ specific data points from the database by searching through the usernames. | This will be different for each type of database being made, however the general format stays the same. Since this is a text database, to pull specific information from the database, the API will __ through the data using the username, which is unique. | The function defined previously, find_by_username(), is used to search through the database and pull the specific data point that is being searched. | If the user exists, the data of that user will be returned, being sent to the __ of the program. | If a user isn&#39;t found, an error will be returned that the user does not exist. | . | In general, the program will always be searching for a piece of information that is unique and that will be used to pull data to wherever it is being requested. | . def get(self): # requested username turned into variable for later use username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) # username used to search for data and the found data is made into a variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # data is sent to the frontend return user.to_dict() # error checking return {&quot;message&quot;: user}, 404 . POST Method . This method is used to add__ a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | This is again different for each database that is made, however the general structure stays the same. In this example, a parser is being used to extract data from an incoming __. In this case, the RequestParser class is used from the Flask module. All required arguments are added to the parser, specifying what type of data it is. | The ____ variable is added in order to parse and store all incoming data. | . | The variable leaderboard is created to make a new object that will contain the values from the incoming data. | The function will attempt to add a new entry in the leaderboard database and return a status of a successful addition of the data. | If there is an error in the data being inputted, a status code of __ will be returned. | . | . def post(self): # using parsers to gather and data that is to be posted and validate it&#39;s true parser = reqparse.RequestParser() parser.add_argument(&quot;username&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;password&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsHard&quot;, required=True, type=int) # variable made to store data args = parser.parse_args() # variable created to format all data into one place and send to database for logging leaderboard = Leaderboard(args[&quot;username&quot;], args[&quot;password&quot;], args[&quot;pointsEasy&quot;], args[&quot;pointsMedium&quot;], args[&quot;pointsHard&quot;]) try: # data is sent to the database for storage db.session.add(leaderboard) db.session.commit() return leaderboard.to_dict(), 201 except Exception as e: # error checking db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . PUT Method . This method is used to __ a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | For each data base that is made, there will be different specific but the overall structure stays the same. First, the username variable is defined, which __ the requested username and sets it as a variable that will be used later to edit a specific dataset. | The function find_by_username() is again used to search through the data to look for the username requested. This is set to a variable to be used later. | If the username is found in the database, the rest of the dataset is updated with the new __ requested. This is updated into the database. | If there is an error found with the data requested of it the user isn&#39;t found, an error is returned. | . | . def put(self): # variable created to make requested username into something that can be used to search for data in future username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # attempts to find the data in the database user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the data is found, the data points are updates user.pointsEasy = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;)) user.pointsMedium = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;)) user.pointsHard = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsHard&quot;)) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict(), 201 else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . DELETE Method . This method is used to __ a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific __ will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an __ is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Displaying the Full Database . Another class is created in order to __ the entire database at once and also to delete the entire database if necessary. | This uses the same functions as before to GET and DELETE the data, however it is modified slightly to look through the entire database abd display or delete all data points. | An example of where this would be useful is to create a table of data in the __. | . class LeaderboardListAPI(Resource): # GET method def get(self): try: # attempts to find the entire database requested and is stored in variable leaderboards = db.session.query(Leaderboard).all() # sends back the entire database return [leaderboard.to_dict() for leaderboard in leaderboards] except Exception as e: # error checking for request errors db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 # DELETE method def delete(self): try: # deletes entire database db.session.query(Leaderboard).delete() db.session.commit() return [] except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 .

They are URI&#39;s to connect to application with request and receive response | Frontend and How it Communicates to Backend . This first part of the frontend logic simply finds out of the site is running locally or not, off of which is figures out whether or not to pull data from the local backend link or the global backend link. In this example, a global backend link hasn&#39;t been sent, however it would go in the second set of quotations after the local address. This isn&#39;t something you need to know, but it is nice to use when developing full stack applications. . // checks if site is run locally const isLocalhost = Boolean( window.location.hostname === &quot;localhost&quot; || window.location.hostname === &quot;[::1]&quot; || window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?: .(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/) ) // defines database url const api = isLocalhost ? &quot;http://localhost:8200&quot; : &quot;&quot;; . GET Method . This method is more complicated in terms of requesting, simply because in order to, for example, print all data points into a __, the function needs to iterate through the entire database. | In this example, the function getList() is used to asynchronously fetch the entire database and set it to a variable called list. The list is returned for later use outside of this __ in order to print the data. | . | . Printing the Data . In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it __ through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as __ to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the __ of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the __ POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the __ string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, __, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the __ requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the __ that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with __ by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) .

It performs async request and provides a promise. | How is data formatted and sent to the backend? (mention JSON in your answer) Into HTML | Time and Space Complexity of Algorithms . The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a ___. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to ___, where ___ is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales ___. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to ___. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as _, where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to _, we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. .

That is, when would you use a for loop and when would you use a while loop? | In the APCSP AP exam, what number do indexes start with? important to know | Are dictionaries and lists mutable? | Simulations/Interactions . Building a simulation o#r interaction using lists and iteration in VS Code can be accomplished using a few simple steps: . Define your data: First, you need to define the data that your simulation will be working with. This could be a list of numbers, a list of strings, or any other type of data that your simulation will be manipulating. . | Write your simulation code: Once you have defined your data, you can start writing the code for your simulation. This code will typically involve iterating over your list of data, performing some operation on each item in the list, and updating the list accordingly. . | Test your simulation: After you have written your simulation code, it is important to test it to make sure it is working as expected. You can do this by running your code and checking the output to see if it matches what you expect. . | Refine your simulation: Once you have tested your simulation, you may need to refine it based on the results. This could involve tweaking the code to make it more efficient, adding new features, or fixing any bugs that you have discovered. . | Why use simulations? . Simulations can be useful because they can emulate real world situations without needing excessive resources (ex: money), time, or equipment. For example, a simulation of the effectiveness of a new seatbelt or airbag can be performed by simulating car crashes. This would be better than doing it in real life because you wouldn&#39;t want to place people in cars and then crash them for obvious reasons. | However, simulatins do assume things about the real world and can have biases. They can be oversimplified because the real world often has more complications and factors that can affect something. In the case of our car crash simulation, other things can have a big impact, such as the weather and experience of the driver. However, these things can sometimes be held constant in the simulations. | . Questions: . Explain an example of something you could simulate. | Why are simulations useful and important? | Here&#39;s a simple example of a simulation in Python that uses lists and iteration to calculate the average of a list of numbers: . numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Initialize the sum and count variables sum = 0 count = 0 # Iterate over the list of numbers, adding each number to the sum for number in numbers: sum += number count += 1 # Calculate the average of the list of numbers average = sum / count # Print the average print(&quot;The average of the list is:&quot;, average) . The average of the list is: 3.0 . This code defines a list of numbers, iterates over the list to calculate the sum and count of the numbers, and then calculates the average by dividing the sum by the count. Finally, it prints the average to the console. . Lists . Iteration statements can be used to traverse a list | Knowldege of exisiting algorithms that use iteration can help in constructing new algorithms. Some are: Determining a minimum or maximum value in a list | Computing a sum or average of a list of numbers | . | . What are Lists? . Lists are _________________. | Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing | In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order | Lists can also be called arrays | Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list. | . Nested Lists . Uses of Nested lists . Placing lists within lists allows you to have arrays of similar data together, and create complexity. . Some uses include: . Creating 2d Arrays | Storing similar, but slightly different categories (sublists) | Create a matrix | . Iteration . Iterative statements are also called _____, and they repeat themselves over and over until the condition for stopping is met. . In College Board&#39;s Pseudocode, the first is a REPEAT n TIMES loop, where the n represents some number. | . The second type of loop is a REPEAT UNTIL (condition) loop, where the loop will continue to run until a condition is met. . Conceptually, a while loop is very similar to an if conditional, except that a while is continually executed until it&#39;s no longer true and an if is only executed once. . Questions: . Describe a situation where you would need iteration. | Describe the difference between a &quot;REPEAT n TIMES&quot; loop VS a &quot;REPEAT UNTIL (condition)&quot; loop. it is important you know this for the AP Exam | Libaries . A software library contains procedures that may be used in creating new programs. | Existing code segments can come from internal or external sources, such as libaries or previously written code. | The use of libaries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | . APIs . Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a libary behave and can be used as documentation for an API/libary is necessary in understanding the behaviors provided by the API and how to use them. . A file that contains procedures that can be used in a program is considered a libary. . API provides specifications for how procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Many companies use APIs for programmers to interact with their products. | . Questions: . What are some libraries that we&#39;ve learned about? What are their advantages/disadvantages? | Dictionaries . What are Dictionaries? . an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is _______ and associated with a specific value | known as associative arrays, maps, or hash tables in some programming languages | used to store and retrieve data efficiently, as they allow fast access to values based on their associated keys | useful for a wide range of tasks, such as storing, indexing, and counting | . What are the types of Dictionaries? . Ordered Dictionaries . Iterates over keys and values in the same order that the keys were inserted | If an entry is deleted and reinserted, then it will be moved to the end of the dictionary | Specially designed to keep its items ordered | Useful in situations where the order of insertion is important and when you need to process data in a specific order | If the order of the data is important, an ordered dictionary is the better choice | . How to create an ordered dictionary? . Import OrderedDict from collections | Create an empty ordered dictionary by instantiating OrderedDict without providing arguments to the constructor | Add key-value pairs to the dictionary by providing a key in square brackets ([]) and assigning a value to that key. | Print the ordered dictionary | Iterate over the items in the ordered dictionary | Regular Dictionaries . Mutable; can add, remove, and modify key-value pairs after they have been created | Used to store data values in key:value pairs | Can be iterated over using loops | If order is not important, a regular dictionary may provide better performance | . How to create a regular dictionary? . Create a variable name which will be the name of the dictionary | Assign the variable to an empty set of curly braces {} | Create a dictionary with the dict() OR empty curly brackets | Questions: .

Code Examples . Reverse a list utilizing features of lists and iteration . original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(&quot;List before reverse : &quot;,original_list) reversed_list = [] for value in original_list: reversed_list = [value] + reversed_list # print(&quot;List after reverse : &quot;, reversed_list) . List before reverse : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Similar to insertion sort, this algorithm takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array. Unlike insertion sort where you iterate through the each element and move the smaller elements to the front, this algorithm starts at the beginning and swaps the position of every element in the array . list = [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] print(f&quot;array before sort {list}&quot;) def insertion_sort(list): for index in range(1,len(list)): # repeats through length of the array value = list[index] i = index - 1 while i &gt;= 0: if value &lt; list[i]: list[i+1] = list[i] # shift number in slot i to the right list[i] = value # shift value left into slot i i = i - 1 else: break IS = insertion_sort(list) # print(f&quot;array after sort {list}&quot;) . array before sort [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] .

            "title": "P3-M 4/28 Introduction to SASS",
            "content": "What is SASS? . Sass is a preprocessor language that&#39;s interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that&#39;s used as input by another program. This means when you run Sass code, you&#39;re actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser. Fun fact CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. . SCSS vs. CSS . Understanding the differences between SCSS and CSS . What is CSS . CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user. . | However, CSS is not very easy to work with lacking a lot features often making using CSS very confusing and difficult or hard to work with on lengthy projects. This is why there are tools like Bootstrap, Sass, and Tailwind that make styling a lot easier and more efficient. We will be using Sass in this course. . | . CSS Example . This is an example of CSS that can be used to change body text of an HTML document | Hack Question:Can you guess what its changing style of the text to? | . body{ color: #0000FF; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . What is SCSS . SCSS is short for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. | SCSS very similar to CSS but the difference comes with the fact that SCSS extends the functionality of CSS while also making it simpler. What this allows us to do is it enables us to things like nested styling, functions, mixins, variables, inheritance (more on these later) and so on. | . Sass Code Example . $blue: #0000FF; body{ color: $blue; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . This example is doing the same thing as the other code segment above but the difference being that here we defined the color as $blue which makes it much easier for us to recall later on. In fact, we have done this before, if you have been using the dark mode/midnight theme then go ahead and navigate your your _sass folder and check out the dark-mode.scss and you&#39;ll see something similar to the example above | . So which one is better to use? . CSS tends to be better for really simple styling where not many complex or nested styles are required and small projects that doesn&#39;t require a lot of customization. | SCSS on the other hand is very good for more complex styling and working with a project with more than one page where maybe lots of customization is needed. Such as the projects we made last and first trimester. | . Modular SCSS . Understanding how to use modular SCSS . Modular SCSS allows you to break multiple different files and then be able to compile them into a single CSS file | How do you do this? Well all you need to do is have _filenames.scss so that is compiled into its own file | Now after adding the to the file name you can import it into you file without the and all the styles will be carried over. | The benefits of a partial is that it allows you to big websites and allows you to break up the code in multiple components and easily make changes instead of having to go through a huge file. | All styles in the partial will be added and can be used into the main file as if they were defined in the main file. | . File 1 _variable.scss . $primary-button-color: #009494; $hover-color: black; $menu-color: #f2f2f2; . File 2 style.scss . We can see the importing of the .scss file&#39;s content into the other main .scss file style.scss | . {@import &#39;variables&#39;; @import &quot;{{ site.theme }}&quot;;} /* &quot;row style&quot; is flexible size and aligns pictures in center */ .row { align-items: center; display: flex; } /* &quot;column style&quot; is one-third of the width with padding */ .column { flex: 33.33%; padding: 5px; } .menu a { // float: left; display: block; color: $menu-color; text-align: center; // padding: 14px 16px; text-decoration: none; } .menu a:hover { background: $primary-button-color; color: $hover-color; } . Nesting . What is nesting? Where did the birds come from? . Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself). | Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to read. | When we make HTML we often nest different elements within each other and have a clear structure when we look at it. | The problem is that in regular CSS we don&#39;t have that so we need to use SASS to help us organize our code. | . Warning:Don&#39;t nest too much as when the CSS is processed it can make overqualified selectors which can be hard to read and maintain. Which means that it would only target that specific element type and not any other elements that have the same class name. ## Sass Nesting | Through nesting the ul, li, and a selectors within the nav selector makes your CSS better and increases its readability overall. | . nav { ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } li { display: inline-block; } a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } } . CSS - Lack of Nesting . We can see that through the lack of nesting the CSS is not as organized and needs extra information to be able to make it more clear exactly what is being targeted. | . nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } nav li { display: inline-block; } nav a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } . Variables . What is a variable? . A variable is a container that stores information so for instance when you multiple places that refer to one value you can just use the variable name instead of the value. | This is valuable in SASS because it allows you to reuse that value in multiple places throughout you stylesheet. | Variables in CSS preprocessors such as Sass allow you to store information that you can reuse in your stylesheet, such as font stacks, colors, or any other CSS value you anticipate needing. The $ symbol is used in Sass to designate a variable. | . Pro Tip:The reason SASS variables are better than variables in regular CSS is that they are more consider and easier to read with a much simpler syntax. Fun Fact: Variables in SASS came before CSS and often SASS has features long before they are actually added to CSS as a whole. . Variable Example Syntax . $variable-name: value; | Once the sass is processed the variable name is replaced with the value throughout the program. | . $main-font: Calibri, sans-serif; $main-color: #000; $main-color-hover: #000; . Operators . Operators are used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language like in python we can use operators to see if values are equal, add, divide, subtract, multiply, etc. | SASS has a lot of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language as well. They can include == to check if two values are equal and != to check if two values are not equal | + to add two values together | - to subtract two values | * to multiply two values | / to divide two values | % to find the remainder of two values | &lt; to check if one value is less than another | &gt; to check if one value is greater than another | &lt;= to check if one value is less than or equal to another | &gt;= to check if one value is greater than or equal to another | Also there is and, or, &amp; not to be able to use boolean operations | . | . Operator Example Syntax . Operators are used in this example to perform string concatenation | . // Html &lt;p id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;original text and&lt;/p&gt; // SASS #testing:after{ content: &quot; some&quot; + &quot; more&quot; + &quot; text&quot;; } // Output original text and some more text . Conditional Statements . There are conditional statements in SASS just like in Python and JavaScript they work the same way as well. | Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Such as if a certain condition is true then do this, if it is false then do that and so on. | SASS has @if which allows for different styles based on if a boolean expression was true or false. | SASS has @else which allows for different set of styles if the if condition was not met or false. | SASS has @else if which allows for an alternative conditions to be run if the first is not met. | . $color: red; button { @if $color == red { background-color: $color; } } // @else: allows you to provide an alternative set of styles to apply if the condition in the @if statement isn&#39;t met $color: blue; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else { background-color: $color; } } // @else if: allows you to provide multiple alternative conditions to test $color: green; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else if $color == blue { background-color: blue; } @else { background-color: $color; } } . Loops In Sass . Loops are present in SASS through the @for and @while decorators, along with @each. | Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met just like in any other programming language. . For Loops: Are used to iterate through a value like a list or a range of numbers | While Loops: Are used to iterate through a block of code until a certain condition is met such as a value is being equal to a certain value through an incrementing or decrementing a variable or any other condition that is met. | . | When using while loops they can be necessary but it is better to use @each and @for as it will make it clear and be able to compile faster. . | Side Note: In SASS lists care a any group of values that are separated by a comma or a space there is no special brackets used like in python or javascript. Lists can be searched for values however they are immutable meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. . | . Some Code Examples of Loops and Lists . // A for each loop is used to interact with a group of sizes changing // the size of the element for each item in the list $sizes: 40px, 50px, 80px; @each $size in $sizes { .icon-#{$size} { font-size: $size; height: $size; width: $size; } } // @each: allows you to loop over a list of values and generate styles $colors: red, green, blue; @each $color in $colors { .color-#{$color} { background-color: $color; } } . @debug list.index(1px solid red, 1px); // 1 @debug list.index(1px solid red, solid); // 2 @debug list.index(1px solid red, dashed); // null . @use &quot;sass:math&quot;; /// Divides `$value` by `$ratio` until it&#39;s below `$base`. @function scale-below($value, $base, $ratio: 1.618) { @while $value &gt; $base { $value: math.div($value, $ratio); } @return $value; } $normal-font-size: 16px; sup { font-size: scale-below(20px, 16px); } . $base-color: #036; @for $i from 1 through 3 { ul:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) { background-color: lighten($base-color, $i * 5%); } } // @for: allows you to loop over a range of values and generate styles @for $i from 1 through 3 { .item-#{$i} { width: 100px * $i; } } . Functions in SASS . What is a function? . A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. This is a great method to be able to reuse code and processes in a manner that is more efficient and allows for the reuse of code. We do this all the time in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. | . SASS functions . Sass Functions allow you to define complex calculations and transformations that can be used throughout your stylesheet and allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, plus you can generate content dynamically. . | There a are built in functions and ones you can make on your own like languages such as JavaScript and Python. . | SASS functions can be used to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate colors, work with strings, and more. . | Functions in SASS are similar to functions in programming languages, but they can be used within SASS stylesheets to generate CSS code dynamically. . | . Using Built-in Functions . Like Python and Javascript SASS provides a variety of built-in functions for math, color manipulation, string manipulation, and more. | . Math Functions . SASS has many functions that allow you to be able to perform wide range of math operations similar to the ones present in python including more complex operations. | . .round(1.2); // returns 1 .ceil(1.2); // returns 2 .floor(1.2); // returns 1 .abs(-1.2); // returns 1.2 .min(1, 2, 3); // returns 1 .max(1, 2, 3); // returns 3 .random(1, 100); // returns a random number between 1 and 100 . Color Functions . Color is an important component of any website and SASS provides a wide range of functions that allow you to manipulate colors in a variety of ways. | . .lighten(#007fff, 20%); // returns a lighter shade of blue .darken(#007fff, 20%); // returns a darker shade of blue .opacify(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more opaque .transparentize(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more transparent .mix(#007fff, #ff0000, 50%); // returns a mix of two colors . String Functions . SASS provides a variety of string functions that allow you to manipulate strings. Here are some examples: | . .to-upper-case(&quot;hello world&quot;); // returns &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; .to-lower-case(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;); // returns &quot;hello world&quot; .str-index(&quot;hello world&quot;, &quot;world&quot;); // returns the index of the first occurrence of &quot;world&quot; .str-insert(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; world&quot;, 5); // inserts &quot; world&quot; into &quot;hello&quot; at position 5 . Creating Custom Functions . In addition to using built-in functions, you can also create your own functions in SASS using the @function name(arguments){} | @return is similar to the return statement in JavaScript and Python. It returns a value from a function. | Functions take input values, perform calculations, and return a result. Here&#39;s an example of a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle: | . @function rectangle-area($width, $height) { @return $width * $height; } // Usage: $area: rectangle-area(10px, 20px); // Returns 200px . Or you can also make a different kind of function that increases the font size to the factorial of a inputted number. | . @function factorial($number){ $calculated: 1; @for $_ from 1 through $number { $calculated: $calculated*$number; } @return $calculated; } #testing { font-size: factorial(3); } . //Combining functions and loops to achieve different sass effects @function sum($numList){ $sum: 0; @each $num in $numList { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $num; } @function tri($num){ $sum: 0; @for $i from 1 through $num { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $sum; } @function max($nums){ $i:0; $value:0px; @while $i&lt;length($nums){ @if $value&lt;list.nth($nums,$i){ $value:list.nth($nums,$i); } } } . Custom functions are very powerful, and can be used to create reusable pieces of code that can be used throughout your stylesheets. . | SASS functions are a powerful feature that allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, and generate content dynamically. By using built-in functions and creating your own custom functions, you can greatly extend the capabilities of your SASS stylesheets. . | . Mixins . Mixin what is a mix in what are we mixing in? . Mixins are a way to make groups of CSS that you want to reuse throughout your site anywhere you please. | Mixins are a form of template and that you can use to build on top of to make different features later on this prevents you from having to write the same code over and over again. | This is a form of encapsulation in your CSS and is a great way to make your code more organized and easier to read. | Mixins can also take in arguments and be able to be used to apply effects on certain elements if that is a feature you want to add to your site. However unlike functions which also take arguments mixins cannot return values. | To use a mixin declare it with @mixin and then incorporate with @include. | . Inheritance . What is inheritance? . In general programming concept where the child class can inherit properties from the parent class. These properties can be changed and modified in the child class. This prevents code from being repeated and makes the code more usable and flexible. | In SASS we have a similar concept that can be used as well we can create base styles and then have other styles inherit from them and then we can change them as we please. | We can do that by through using @extend .name-of-class and then we can add more styles to it as we please. Simple as that | . Mixin &amp; Inheritance Code Example . // example of @mixin @mixin button { width: auto; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #21807c; border: 3px solid black; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; grid-column: span 1; grid-row: span 1; // creates smooth animation effect transition: all 0.5s; } // default button theme for calculator and stopwatch buttons.

Understand the concept of data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and 2D arrays | Learn how to iterate through data structures using loops | Able to visualize data structures and iteration processes | Able to apply their knowledge to build simulations/interactions using lists and iteration | Learn how to store list and dictionary content in databases | . Lesson 1: Lists and Iteration . Lists (Ethan) . Lists are a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a single variable | Lists are defined using square brackets [ ] | Each item in a list is separated by a comma | Lists are indexed, starting at 0 | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;] print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Accessing Lists . To access individual items in a list, we use the index of the item. | Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first item in the list has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on. | . print(fruits[0]) print(fruits[2]) . apple orange . Slicing Lists . We can also extract a specific portion of a list using slicing. | We use the colon : operator to specify a range of indices to include. | . print(fruits[0:2]) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;] . Modifying List Items . Lists are mutable, meaning that we can change the value of an item in a list. | To change the value of an item in a list, we can use the indexing operator (square brackets) to access the item and then assign a new value to it. | . fruits[2] = &quot;pear&quot; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Adding and Removing List Items . Adding . Use the append() method to add an item to the end of a list. | . fruits.append(&quot;kiwi&quot;) # Adds &#39;kiwi&#39; to the end of the list print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the insert() method to add an item to a specific index in a list. | . fruits.insert(1, &quot;peach&quot;) # Inserts &quot;peach&quot; at index 1 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Removing . Use the remove() method to remove the first occurrence of an item from a list. | . fruits.remove(&#39;pear&#39;) # Removes the first occurrence of &#39;pear&#39; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the pop() method to remove the item at a specific index from a list. | . fruits.pop(2) # Removes the item at index 2 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the clear() method to remove all items from a list. | . fruits.clear() # Removes all items from the list print(fruits) . [] . Function Explanation . InsertToList . This function is designed to insert a new item into a list at a specific index. | It first retrieves the new item to be added and the index at which to add it from the HTML document. | It checks if the retrieved values are both valid integers and if the index is within the range of the list. | If the values are valid, the function uses the splice() method to insert the new item into the list at the specified index. | In JavaScript, the splice() method modifies an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements. | The splice() method takes three arguments:the index at which to start changing the list, the number of elements to remove, and the new item to add. - The item is inserted without removing any elements, so we pass 0 as the second argument. | Finally, the function calls the visualizeList() function to display the updated list on the web page. | . // Get the value of the new item and the index where it should be inserted function insertToList() { let newItem = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;newItem&quot;).value); let index = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;index&quot;).value); if (!isNaN(newItem) &amp;&amp; !isNaN(index) &amp;&amp; index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt;= myList.length) { // splice() method to insert the new item into the list myList.splice(index - 1, 0, newItem); // Call the visualizeList() function to update the display of the list visualizeList(); } } . SortList . In JavaScript, sort() is a built-in method used to sort the elements of an array in place. The default sort order is ascending, but you can also specify a descending sort order. | In this case, the function sorts myList in ascending order based on their numerical value. | . // Sort myList array in ascending order function sortList() { // The function a - b is used, which subtracts the second element b from the first element a. // If the result is negative, a is sorted before b. If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. If the result is zero, the order of the elements is unchanged. myList.sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b); visualizeList(); } . Applications of Lists . Data processing: Lists are commonly used to store and process large amounts of data. In data analysis and machine learning, lists are often used to store datasets. . | Gaming: Lists are used extensively in game development to store game objects, player statistics, and game maps. . | Finance: Lists are used in finance to store and process financial data, such as stock prices and market trends. The data from these lists can also be used to calculate financial metrics and to create financial models. . | . Hacks (0.3) . Make your own list and manipulate it via accessing specific elements, adding or removing elements, etc. | Extra: Make an interactable visualization that can manipulate elements in a list such as the one demonstrated in our flask repository | . Iteration (Alex) . What is iteration? . In programming, iteration refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. This can be achieved using loop structures like for loops and while loops. | . For Loops . A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a list, tuple, string, etc.) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a for loop in Python: | . sequence = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] for variable in sequence: print(variable) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . my_string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; for character in my_string: print(character) . H e l l o , W o r l d ! . While Loops A while loop is used to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a while loop in Python: . num = 0 while num &lt; 5: print(num) num += 1 . 0 1 2 3 4 . Applications of Iteration . Iteration is a fundamental concept in computer programming and is used in a variety of real-life applications. Here are some examples:Data Processing . Data processing often involves iterating over large datasets to perform specific operations on each element. For example, in a data analysis task, you might iterate over a list of numbers to compute the average, or iterate over a list of strings to find the longest string. | . User Interfaces . User interfaces often involve iteration to display and handle data from various sources. For example, in a web application, you might iterate over a list of users to display their information in a table. Similarly, in a desktop application, you might iterate over a list of files to display them in a file explorer. | . Machine Learning . Machine learning algorithms often involve iterative processes to train models and improve their accuracy. For example, in a gradient descent algorithm, you might iterate over a set of training data to update the model&#39;s parameters and minimize the loss function. | . Popcorn hack (0.3) . Make a list related to your CPT project | Make a while loop that will print each term in the list | Make a for loop that will print each term in the list | . Simulation mechanics . In Python, pop() is a method that is used to remove and return an element from a list. The syntax for using pop() is as follows: | . print(&quot;For Forwards&quot;) # iterate forward students = [&quot;Ellie&quot;, &quot;Haseeb&quot;, &quot;Theo&quot;, &quot;Luna&quot;] for s in students: print(s) print(&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;While Backwards&quot;) # countdown backwards n = len(students) - 1 while n &gt;= 0: print(students[n]) n -= 1 .

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 3, 4] . In Python, append() is a built-in method that is used to add an element to the end of a list. The syntax for using append() is as follows: . my_list = [] my_list.append(1) my_list.append(2) my_list.append(3) print(my_list) . [1, 2, 3] . Dictionary Lesson / 2D Arrays .

Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: .

DELETE Method . This method is used to delete a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific variables will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an error is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 .

This first part of the frontend logic simply finds out of the site is running locally or not, off of which is figures out whether or not to pull data from the local backend link or the global backend link. In this example, a global backend link hasn&#39;t been sent, however it would go in the second set of quotations after the local address. This isn&#39;t something you need to know, but it is nice to use when developing full stack applications. . // checks if site is run locally const isLocalhost = Boolean( window.location.hostname === &quot;localhost&quot; || window.location.hostname === &quot;[::1]&quot; || window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?: .(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/) ) // defines database url const api = isLocalhost ? &quot;http://localhost:8200&quot; : &quot;&quot;; . GET Method . This method is more complicated in terms of requesting, simply because in order to, for example, print all data points into a table, the function needs to iterate through the entire database. | In this example, the function getList() is used to asynchronously fetch the entire database and set it to a variable called list. The list is returned for later use outside of this function in order to print the data. | . | . Printing the Data . In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it iterates through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as parameters to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the array of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the HTTP POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the JSON string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, headers, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the method requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the base64 that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with css by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) .

(mention JSON in your answer) | Time and Space Complexity of Algorithms . The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a pivot. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to log(n), where n is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales linearly. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to n. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as O(nlogn), where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to O(logn), we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. .

Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: . Please write a few sentences answering the essential question, &quot;What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application?&quot; . - . Endpoints . What are endpoints and how do we use them to transfer data from one part of the internet to another? . Backend: . The backend creates endpoints that are used to edit the properties of the database constructed by the model. | ___GET_, _PUT___, _POST___, and _DELETE___ methods are used in order to define HTTP endpoints in the API.

This method is used to __ a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | For each data base that is made, there will be different specific but the overall structure stays the same. First, the username variable is defined, which __ the requested username and sets it as a variable that will be used later to edit a specific dataset. | The function find_by_username() is again used to search through the data to look for the username requested. This is set to a variable to be used later. | If the username is found in the database, the rest of the dataset is updated with the new __ requested.

DELETE Method . This method is used to __ a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific __ will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an __ is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Displaying the Full Database . Another class is created in order to __ the entire database at once and also to delete the entire database if necessary. | This uses the same functions as before to GET and DELETE the data, however it is modified slightly to look through the entire database abd display or delete all data points. | An example of where this would be useful is to create a table of data in the __. | . class LeaderboardListAPI(Resource): # GET method def get(self): try: # attempts to find the entire database requested and is stored in variable leaderboards = db.session.query(Leaderboard).all() # sends back the entire database return [leaderboard.to_dict() for leaderboard in leaderboards] except Exception as e: # error checking for request errors db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 # DELETE method def delete(self): try: # deletes entire database db.session.query(Leaderboard).delete() db.session.commit() return [] except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 .

GET Method . This method is more complicated in terms of requesting, simply because in order to, for example, print all data points into a __, the function needs to iterate through the entire database. | In this example, the function getList() is used to asynchronously fetch the entire database and set it to a variable called list.

In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it __ through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as __ to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the __ of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the __ POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the __ string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, __, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the __ requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the __ that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with __ by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) .

The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a ___. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to ___, where ___ is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales ___. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to ___. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as _, where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to _, we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. .

            "content": "Review Topics . All of the topics below are things that have been heavily covered and used throughout the class. We will mostly be focusing on more complicated uses and mechanics of these topics. . Lists . What are Lists? Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable | Unlike dictionaries, lists&#39; keys are all integers that describe the order of the list | . | . Some examples of lists: . Playlist of songs | names of students in a class | contacts on your phone . | Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1. . AP Exam: 1,2,3,4 etc. | Python: 0,1,2,3 etc. | . | . How do lists Manage Complexity of a program? . We may not need as many variables. For example: One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student | There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time | . | . Answer the following questions about the code block below: . Why do you think lists are helpful? What word does College Board like to use to describe the function of lists? | . # variable of type string name = &quot;Sri Kotturi&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;, &quot;html&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[2]&quot;, langs[2], type(langs[2])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[2] Java &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Sri Kotturi&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . Mathematical Expressions . What is the output of the cell below? What Mathematical Expressions do you see being used? (List them below.) . - . grade1 = 10 grade2 = grade1 average_grade = (grade1 + grade2) // 2 #what are these two slashes? print(average_grade) . 10 . What is the value of num1, num2, and num3? Explain how each number ended up what it was. . - . - . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 ** num3 num3 = num1 % 5 num2 = (num1 + num3) // 9 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 4096 455 1 . Selection . Selection refers to the process of __ in a program based on certain conditions. It is normally done with conditional statements. . Conditionals . What is a conditional?: . Statement that allows code to execute different instructions if a certain condition is _ | Allows program to make decisions based on data and input | . What are the main types of conditional statements?: . if | elif | else | . If statements . The if statement is used to check if a certain condition is true. The condition can be any expression that evaulates to a boolean value, True or False. If the condition is True, then it executes a code block. | If (condition) then (consequence) | Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met . x is positive . Else . The else statemnt executes a code block when the if condition is False. | If (condition) then (consequence A), else (consequence B) | . Elif . The elif statement can check ___ conditions in a sequence, and execute a certain block of code if any of the conditions are true. | If (condition) then (consequence A), elif (condition) then (consequence B), else (consequence C) . | Example adding onto the code from before to take negative numbers and 0 into account . | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met elif x &lt; 0: # if previous condition not true... elif condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is negative&quot;)# code that will execute if condition is met else: # everything else, in this case it is if x == 0 print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) # only executes if all previous conditions are not met . Nested Conditionals . What is a nested conditional?: . Conditional statement inside another ___ statement | Allows to check for more complex condition where one condition depends on another | . Nested Conditional Statements . Example | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(&quot;x is even divisible by 2&quot;) # only ever checks is x is divisble by 3 if x is even. nested conditional if x % 3 == 0: print(&quot;x is divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is odd&quot;) . x is even divisible by 2 x is divisible by 3 . Indentation . When using conditionals and nested conditionals in Python, it is important to pay attention to the ___ in the code. The code inside the if, elif, and else blocks must be indented so they are nested wihtin the outer statements. This way, Python knows which code belongs to which block. . Binary Search . What is binary search and what is it used for?: . . Find and select a specific element in a sorted list of elements | . How does binary search work?: . Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the middle element and __ the middle value to the target value, if not the same then it continues on to either the lower or upper half | Eliminate half of the remaining search interval elements each time | Efficient way to search for element in large dataset | . What is the time complexity and why?: . O(log(N)) | The maximum number of iterations is the amount of times the list can be divided in half until it reaches 1 number | Dividing by 2, so it is log2(N), logarigthm of n base 2 . | You may recognize the example below from the binary lesson last Friday . | . import random def binary_search_game(): low = 1 high = 100 target = random.randint(low, high) while True: guess = (low + high) // 2 print(f&quot;Is your number {guess}?&quot;) response = input(&quot;Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: &quot;) # conditional statements to check target number and guess if response == &#39;yes&#39;: print(f&quot;I guessed your number {guess}!&quot;) break elif response == &#39;higher&#39;: low = guess + 1 elif response == &#39;lower&#39;: high = guess - 1 else: print(&quot;Invalid input, please enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;.&quot;) binary_search_game() . Is your number 50? Is your number 25? Is your number 12? Is your number 6? Is your number 9? Is your number 7? I guessed your number 7! . Quick Hack . Write a program using conditionals and nested conditionals . Ideas: Quiz, game (rock paper scissors, guess number), etc | . response = input(&quot;Enter &#39;rock(r)&#39;, &#39;paper(p)&#39;, or &#39;scissors(s)&#39;: &quot;) . Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a __ that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to __. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like ___ to organize and search through data. | . Important Terms . What is an algorithm? . it is a ___ set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task | . Sequencing . means that there is an _ in which to do things | . Selection . Helps to choose _ based off of a decision that the programmer wants to make | . Iteration . Repeat something until the condition is met. (also referred to as repetition) | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a ___ that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to __. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The sum of 5 and 7 is 12 . The result of the procedure can be __, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program ___, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . The average of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] is 30.0 . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of __ needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its __. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the ___ required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | can be analyzed using __, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | . | . What is the time complexity of the following code: . - O(N) - O(N*log(N)) - O(N * Sqrt(N)) - O(N*N) . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i, N)): a = a + i + j .

Efficiency can be improved by _ or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the ___, caching results, and ___. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | . | . Iteration and Simulations . Simulations are _ or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model __ that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . PLEASE RUN THE CODE BELOW BEFORE INTERACTING WITH THE CODE SEGMENTS IN THIS SECTION! . class Card: def __init__(self, suit, val): self.suit = suit self.val = val if val == 11: self.kind = &quot;Ace&quot; elif val == 12: self.kind = &quot;Jack&quot; elif val == 13: self.kind = &quot;Queen&quot; elif val == 14: self.kind = &quot;King&quot; else: self.kind = str(self.val) #return a formatted string version of a card def show(self): return f&quot;{self.kind} of {self.suit}&quot; #adjust aces to prevent breaking def ace_adj(self): if self.kind == &quot;Ace&quot;: self.val = 1 . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In a card game, for example, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. . For Loops . For loops are probably the most well-known type of iterative loop used in code. Most of us know about the for variable in list format. . One helpful tool not a lot of people know about is the enumerate() function. When used in conjunction with a for loop, you can always have _ and value of each selected list entry. . numlist = [3, 5, 68, 203] for key, num in enumerate(numlist): print(f&quot;This entry&#39;s index is {str(key)}, but its value is {str(num)}.&quot;) print(f&quot;The difference between the value and the index is {num - key}.&quot;) .

QUESTION: How is the key, num in enumerate(list) format similar to the format used when applying a for loop to a dictionary? . Answer: __ . List Comprehension . You may also see for loops used within a list like below. We went over this in class fairly recently. In this case, it is used to show the cards in the hand of a player. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . [&#39;Ace of Diamonds&#39;] . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops have you calling one function inside of another. If a function must make some change to a certain value multiple times, it is oftem most efficient to have a function call itself with slightly different arguments like the fibonacci sequence below. . def fibonacci(terms): if terms &lt;= 1: return terms return fibonacci(terms-1) + fibonacci(terms-2) fibonacci(5) . Nesting Loops . Nesting loops increases the time complexity of the program, but it can be used to do things like make a card deck (see below). . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a __ a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . Student Interaction: How could this build function be altered to function with a while loop within it? . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make an incrementing i variable . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . It took 2 random generations to get 10. . 49 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are _, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like ______ or ________ as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . QUESTION: Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? Do so in the code cell below. . import random #find another random function that could pull a random card from a deck of UNSORTED cards . Simulation Homework . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... . Use of at least one random value | At least one list or similar data type (dictionary, set, etc.) | Efficient use of iteration (must support the purpose of the simualtion) | Selection (use of conditionals) | . Do this in your student copy in the cell provided. This is worth 0.9 (or more with extra credit) out of the 3 possible points. . # (Concert attendance? Wind speeds? Interactions between subjects in large environments?) # Think about the sort of things that could be saved in lists, dictionaries, etc. # (Even better if you can take advantage of the specific features of multiple types of data sets!) # What kind of iteration happens in the real world? # What occurs repeatedly, even over a long period of time? # You could model the results of a disease spreading through a population without it taking IRL years. . Databases . We have already gone over databases in this class, but here is a refresher. A database contains data that&#39;s __. The information in this database can then be __ from the database and can be used in a program. . Setting Up the Database . Run the code cell below to prepare SQLite to create the database. If your system is struggling with the flask functions, verify that you&#39;re in the correct Python environment. REMEMBER: You should only db.init_app(app) ONCE during the process! . from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) . The Model File . The model file plays a crucial role in the formation of the database. . The model helps to create new databases | It provides a standardized method for formating the database entries across different systems | Objects used within the database are created | . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class User(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;players&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _username = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _streak = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._streak = streak # a username getter method, extracts username from object @property def username(self): return self._username # a setter function, allows username to be updated after initial object creation @username.setter def username(self, username): self._username = username # a getter method, extracts streak from object @property def streak(self): return self._streak # a setter function, allows streak to be updated after initial object creation @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None # CRUD read converts self to dictionary # returns dictionary def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;username&quot;: self.username, &quot;streak&quot;: self.streak } # CRUD update: updates user name, password, phone # returns self def update(self, username, streak): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(username) &gt; 0: self.username = username if streak &gt; 0: self.streak = streak db.session.commit() return self # CRUD delete: remove self # None def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(username=&quot;Mr. Cards&quot;, streak=5) u2 = User(username=&quot;Kard Kowntre&quot;, streak=10) u3 = User(username=&quot;Un Bea Table&quot;, streak=15) users = [u1, u2, u3] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with username &quot;{user.username}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.username}&quot;) . The init Fuction . The init method has one purpose which is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes. This is what is known as the constructor. In our project, the init method initalizes the username and streak as variables. . def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._score = streak . Setters and Getters . Setters and Getters are important methods used when writing code for databases. . Setter: a method that allows us to ___ the value of an attribute in a class. | Getter: a method that allows us to __ an attribute in a given class. | . Setter Example . @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak . Getter Example . @property def streak(self): return self._streak . The Api File . An API is an important part of having a functional database. . it acts as a messenger that allows programs to access data from the others | it connects all information | for a database, an api _ the data requested in code for the user | . import json from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building user_api = Blueprint(&#39;user_api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/users&#39;) api = Api(user_api) class UserAPI: class _CRUD(Resource): # User API operation for Create, Read. THe Update, Delete methods need to be implemeented def post(self): # Create method &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) if username is None or len(username) &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Username is missing, or is less than a character&#39;}, 400 # validate uid streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) if streak is None or streak &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Streak is missing, or is less than 1&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(username=username, streak=streak) &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {username}, either a format error or a duplicate&#39;}, 400 def get(self): # Read Method users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps def put(self): body = request.get_json() # get the body of the request id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) # get the UID (Know what to reference) user = User.query.get(id) # get the player (using the uid in this case) user.update(username=username, streak=streak) return f&quot;{user.read()} Updated&quot; def delete(self): body = request.get_json() id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) player = User.query.get(id) player.delete() return f&quot;{player.read()} Has been deleted&quot; # building RESTapi endpoint api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;) . This is important particularly in a full flask respository context, but in this case, you&#39;ll just need to run the initUsers() function. . initUsers() . Created user with username &#34;Mr. Cards&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Kard Kowntre&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Un Bea Table&#34;. . An Alternative Method of Making SQLite Databases . In a previous lesson, we went over using the cursor object in SQLite3. Rather than go over all of that here, this lesson goes over it thoroughly. (You may use this method for the homework below.) . Database Homework . For this assignment, we&#39;d like you to make your own database file as instructed above. Remember, the API file isn&#39;t necessary in this case; you&#39;ll be focusing on making the model and the init function. . Your database must include these things: . A class with at least four attributes (if not the cursor method) | Setters and getters for this class (if not the cursor method) | Each of the CRUD functions | An init function with at least four entries | A screenshot showing proof that your SQLite file has been created correctly | . Feel free to base your database on the model provided above! Ask our group if you have any questions or concerns. . # If you&#39;ve already run the db.init_app(app) function while in this notebook, # don&#39;t do it again until you&#39;ve closed it! . Grading . Your submission will be graded based on the following criteria: . Filling in the blank throughout the lesson and providing code in the given cells when applicable (0.9) | Simulation homework (0.9) | Database homework (0.9) | . Here are some ideas for ways to increase your score above a 2.7: . Make a frontend version of your simulation that can be interacted with on your blog | Connect your simulation to the database you create | Create a menu that allows a user to make an entry in your database (CRUD functions within it) | You can establish a relationship between two classes/tables in your database (see the relationship between the User and Note classes in the Nighthawk Coders flask repository) | .",

In this program, the binary operators &amp; (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), and ~ (NOT) are used to perform the binary operations on the input numbers. The results are stored in separate variables as decimal numbers. Then, the bin() function is used to convert each decimal result to binary, and the binary strings are stored in separate variables. Finally, the program returns a tuple of tuples, with each inner tuple containing both the decimal and binary result for each operation. The outer tuple is unpacked into separate variables for printing, and the results are displayed as both decimal and binary. . def binary_operations(num1, num2): # Perform the binary operations and_result_decimal = num1 &amp; num2 or_result_decimal = num1 | num2 xor_result_decimal = num1 ^ num2 not_result_decimal = ~num1 # Convert results to binary and_result_binary = bin(and_result_decimal)[2:] or_result_binary = bin(or_result_decimal)[2:] xor_result_binary = bin(xor_result_decimal)[2:] not_result_binary = bin(not_result_decimal)[2:] # Return the results as a tuple of tuples return ((and_result_decimal, and_result_binary), (or_result_decimal, or_result_binary), (xor_result_decimal, xor_result_binary), (not_result_decimal, not_result_binary)) # Ask the user for input num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter the first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter the second number: &quot;)) # Call the binary_operations function and print the results and_result, or_result, xor_result, not_result = binary_operations(num1, num2) print(&quot;AND result: decimal =&quot;, and_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, and_result[1]) print(&quot;OR result: decimal =&quot;, or_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, or_result[1]) print(&quot;XOR result: decimal =&quot;, xor_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, xor_result[1]) print(&quot;NOT result: decimal =&quot;, not_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, not_result[1]) . AND result: decimal = 2 , binary = 10 OR result: decimal = 58 , binary = 111010 XOR result: decimal = 56 , binary = 111000 NOT result: decimal = -11 , binary = b1011 . Bitwise operations are used in a variety of applications, particularly in low-level programming and computer science. Some common used of bitwise operations include:&gt; - Flag Management: Flags are used to keep track of the state of a system or a program. Bitwise operations can be used to set, clear, and toggle flags.&gt; - Bit Manipulation:Bitwise operations can be used to manipulate individual bits in a binary number. This is often used to extract specific bits from a number, set specific bits to a particular value, or flip the value of specific bits.&gt; - Masking:Masking is used to extract a specific subset of bits from a binary number. Bitwise operations are commonly used for masking, particularly in low-level programming.&gt; - Encryption:Bitwise operations can be used in cryptographic applications to scramble and unscramble data. One common application of bitwise operations in encryption is the XOR operation.&gt; - Graphics:Bitwise operations can be used in computer graphics to manipulate individual pixels on a screen. This can be used to draw shapes, change colors, and create special effects.&gt; - Networking:Bitwise operations are used extensively in networking applications, particularly in the handling of IP addresses and port numbers. . Binary to String Conversion . This program defines a string_to_binary function that takes a string as input and returns the binary representation of the string. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, the ord function is used to get its ASCII code, which is then converted to binary using the format function with the &#39;08b&#39; format specifier to ensure that each binary number is 8 digits long. The resulting binary numbers are concatenated to form the final binary string. . . # Function to convert a string to binary def string_to_binary(string): binary = &#39;&#39; for char in string: binary += format(ord(char), &#39;08b&#39;) # Convert the character to binary and append to the binary string return binary # Example usage word = input(&quot;Enter a word to convert to binary: &quot;) binary_word = string_to_binary(word) print(f&quot;The binary representation of &#39;{word}&#39; is {binary_word}&quot;) . The binary representation of &#39;word&#39; is 01110111011011110111001001100100 . Many programs use binary conversion, particularly those related to computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics. Programs that rely on binary conversion include:&gt; - Networking: Programs that deal with network addresses, such as IP addresses and subnet masks, use binary conversion to represent and manipulate the addresses.&gt; - Cryptography:Programs that deal with encryption and decryption use binary conversion to encode and decode data.&gt; - Computer Hardware:Programs that interface with computer hardware, such as drivers and firmware, often use binary conversion to communicate with the hardware at the binary level.&gt; - Mathematical Applications:Programs that deal with complex calculations and mathematical analysis, such as statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms, may use binary conversion to represent large numbers or complex data sets.&gt; - Finance:Programs that deal with financial calculations and accounting may use binary conversion to represent fractional amounts or complex financial data. . Binary Search . An algorithm made to find an item from a list of items | Works by dividing the list repeatedly to narrow down which half (the low or high half) that contains the item | Lists of integers are often used with binary search | Binary search makes searching more efficient, as it ensures the program won&#39;t have to search through an entire list of items one by one | List must be sorted | . What are some situations in which binary search could be used? . Real Example of Binary Search . Binary search operates a lot like a &quot;guess the number&quot; game. Try the game and explain how the two are similar. . import random hid = random.randint(0,100) gues = 0 def game(): global gues gues += 1 num = int(input(&#39;Pick a number&#39;)) if num &lt; hid: print(&#39;higher&#39;) game() if num &gt; hid: print(&#39;lower&#39;) game() if num == hid: print(hid) print(&#39;You Win !!!&#39;) print(&#39;guesses: &#39;, gues) game() .

(0.9) . | As your tangible, create a program that allows a user to input two numbers and an operation, converts the numbers to binary and performs the given operation, and returns the value in decimal values. (0.9) . | . Applying Binary Math - Calculator Hack . Calculators use binary math to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.In a calculator, the binary digits are represented by electronic switches that can be either on or off, corresponding to 1 or 0 respectively. These switches are arranged in groups of eight to form bytes, which are used to represent larger numbers. When a user enters a number into a calculator, the number is converted into binary form and stored in the calculator&#39;s memory.To perform an arithmetic operation, the calculator retrieves the numbers from its memory and performs the operation using binary math. . For example, to add the binary numbers 1010 and 1101, the calculator would perform the following steps:&gt; 1. Add the rightmost digits, 0 and 1, which gives a sum of 1.&gt; 2. Move to the next digit to the left and add the digits along with any carry from the previous step. In this case, we have 1 + 0 + 1, which gives a sum of 10. The carry of 1 is then carried over to the next digit. . Repeat step 2 for the remaining digits until all digits have been added. | The result of the addition in this example is the binary number 10111, which is equivalent to the decimal number 23. | Similarly, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed using binary math. The algorithms for these operations are based on the same principles as those used in decimal arithmetic, but with binary digits and powers of 2 instead of decimal digits and powers of 10. . def binary_math(num1, num2, operator): # Write your calculator function here # Ask the user for input num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter the first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter the second number: &quot;)) operator = input(&quot;Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): &quot;) # Call the binary_math function and print the result result = binary_math(num1, num2, operator) print(&quot;Result:&quot;, result) .",

This code calculates the total plate appearances for a baseball player using NumPy&#39;s sum() function, similar to the original example. It then uses NumPy to calculate the total number of bases (hits plus walks) for the player, and divides that by the total number of plate appearances to get the on-base percentage. The results are then printed to the console. . import numpy as np # Example data player_hits = np.array([3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2]) # Player&#39;s hits in each game player_walks = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]) # Player&#39;s walks in each game player_strikeouts = np.array([2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1]) # Player&#39;s strikeouts in each game # array to store plate appearances (PA) for the player total_pa = np.sum(player_hits != 0) + np.sum(player_walks) + np.sum(player_strikeouts) # array to store on-base percentage (OBP) for the player total_bases = np.sum(player_hits) + np.sum(player_walks) obp = total_bases / total_pa # Print the total plate appearances and on-base percentage for the player print(f&quot;Total plate appearances: {total_pa}&quot;) print(f&quot;On-base percentage: {obp:.3f}&quot;) .

Pandas and Data analysis . The 2 most important data structures in Pandas are: . Series ; A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of any type (integer, float, string, etc.). It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a SQL table. Each element in a Series has a label, known as an index. A Series can be created from a list, a NumPy array, a dictionary, or another Pandas Series. | DataFrame ;A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure that can hold data of different types (integer, float, string, etc.). It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. Each column in a DataFrame is a Series, and each row is indexed by a label, known as an index. A DataFrame can be created from a dictionary of Series or NumPy arrays, a list of dictionaries, or other Pandas DataFrame. | . Dataframes . import pandas as pd . pd.__version__ . &#39;1.4.2&#39; .

Stats for Jayson Tatum: PPG RPG APG 9 27.0 10.5 4.0 . In this code segment below we use Pandas to read a CSV file containing NBA player statistics and store it in a DataFrame. . The reason Pandas is useful in this scenario is because it provides various functionalities to filter, sort, and manipulate the NBA data efficiently. In this code, the DataFrame is filtered to only include the stats for the player you guys choose. . Imports the Pandas library and assigns it an alias &#39;pd&#39;. | Loads a CSV file named &#39;nba_player_statistics.csv&#39; into a Pandas DataFrame called &#39;df&#39;. | Asks the user to input a player name using the input() function and assigns it to the variable player_name. | Filters the DataFrame for the specified player name using the df[df[&#39;NAME&#39;] == player_name] syntax, and assigns the resulting DataFrame to the variable player_stats. | Checks if the player_stats DataFrame is empty using the empty attribute.

Example of analyzing data using both NumPy and Pandas libraries | Importing data into NumPy and Pandas Performing basic data analysis tasks such as mean, median, and standard deviation Visualization of data using Matplotlib library | . Example of analyzing data using both NumPy and Pandas libraries . import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Load CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv(&#39;files/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Filter the DataFrame to only include stats for the specified player player_name = input(&quot;Enter player name: &quot;) player_stats = df[df[&#39;NAME&#39;] == player_name] if player_stats.empty: print(&quot;No stats found for that player.&quot;) else: # Convert the player stats to a NumPy array player_stats_np = np.array(player_stats[[&#39;PPG&#39;, &#39;RPG&#39;, &#39;APG&#39;, &#39;P+R+A&#39;]]) # Calculate the average of each statistic for the player player_stats_avg = np.mean(player_stats_np, axis=0) # Print out the average statistics for the player print(f&quot; nAverage stats for {player_name}:&quot;) print(f&quot;PPG: {player_stats_avg[0]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;RPG: {player_stats_avg[1]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;APG: {player_stats_avg[2]:.2f}&quot;) print(f&quot;P+R+A: {player_stats_avg[3]:.2f}&quot;) . Average stats for Austin Reaves: PPG: 23.00 RPG: 3.00 APG: 4.00 P+R+A: 30.00 . NumPy impacts the given code because it performs operations on arrays efficiently. Specifically, it converts a Pandas DataFrame object to a NumPy array object, and then calculates the average statistics for a the player you guys inputted. Without NumPy, it would be more difficult and less efficient to perform these calculations on large data sets. It does the math for us. . Importing data into NumPy and Pandas Performing basic data analysis tasks such as mean, median, and standard deviation Visualization of data using Matplotlib library . Matplotlib is used essentially to create visuals of data. charts,diagrams,etc. . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.read_csv(&#39;files/nba_player_statistics.csv&#39;) # Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame print(df.head()) # Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;Points&#39; column mean_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].mean() median_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].median() stddev_minutes = df[&#39;MPG&#39;].std() # Print the results print(&#39;Mean Minutes: &#39;, mean_minutes) print(&#39;Median Minutes: &#39;, median_minutes) print(&#39;Standard Deviation Minutes: &#39;, stddev_minutes) # Create a histogram of the &#39;Points&#39; column using Matplotlib plt.hist(df[&#39;MPG&#39;], bins=20) plt.title(&#39;MPG Histogram&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;MPG&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Frequency&#39;) plt.show() . In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently . Lesson Portion 5; Summary . Summary/Goals of Lesson: . One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players. .

Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video. In Demo #1, on page load JavaScript obtains data using the backend GET API, the response from the API containing JSON. This JSON file is a collection containing a list of key/values which is iterated over in a JavaScript for loop row by row, each row outputs a corresponding to a row on the Web Page. The resulting table contains each user and their corresponding columnar data. | In the seconde part of Demo #1, demos creating new user information using the backend POST API enpoint. In this case, the data input is passed in the request body. The backend receives the API, validates, and unpacks the JSON data into a Python User object. The User object contains a method to Create a new row in the SQLite table. After data is validated, the row is created. The created row is repacked in JSON and returned as a response to the JavaScript sequence. On return, the data is displayed in the HTM. | . | . Row 2: Data Abstraction . Below are some key ideas to better illustrate multiple levels of Data Abstraction within this project. The frontend allows for display, the backend API allows for JSON transport over the internet, and the backend database and inheritance handle interaction with SQL. . includes two program code segments: one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type). There are two comments in the code that show how data is stored: User Model Class, User Model Tester. | The collection type used to illustrated Data Abstracition is an SQLite database. | The User Model Class code defines a class User(db.Model) which inherits database functionality, through db.Model. This is the file that defines schema for database as well as a template for an object that represent a row of data in the database. | The User Model Tester code defines a function def initUsers(). This function creates a database table using the schema from the User Model Class, aka tablename and db.Column definitions assist in definition of the table. | The User Model Tester instantiates User objects and then adds each of the User objects to a temporary list. The list is used iterate through a process of creating records in the users table. | Each User object needs goes through a process of validation. Adding records is guarded with a try/except block to catch errors. This guard will fail errors and duplicates, but it will continue (error or success)until every record in the list is processed. | The user.create() method in the User class creates a new row in the database table. It validates, adds and then commits the object to the table. | After the creation of the table and adding rows to the to the table, this data is now ready for use in other parts of the program. | A visual of the database is shown by screen capture below with comment users table. | . | . | . &quot;&quot;&quot;

By creating a User object, data can be stagged and validated utilizing methods that are defined in the collection/object discussed in this section. . includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. The User API code show managing complexity with the uo (User Object) which is a type of list or more commonly called a collection data structure. | The class _Create(Resource): has method def post(self): contains the variable body. This is populated with the user input. This collection contains a list of all the keys and values input by user in one varialble. The variable body contains the user input including: uid, name, dob - The input body after it passes initial checks for errors is used to create a User object uo = User(name=name, uid=uid). This uo object, user object, is used in managing the complexity of gathering the user data. The method def post(self) checks data and adds it to the uo object, only after it ensures only clean data enters the &quot;uo&quot; object. | . | . &quot;&quot;&quot; Code Segment for Managing Complexity &quot;&quot;&quot; # Import Section from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building from datetime import datetime # Dependency Section user_api = Blueprint(&#39;user_api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/users&#39;) # API docs https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html api = Api(user_api) &quot;&quot;&quot; User API&quot;&quot;&quot; class UserAPI: class _Create(Resource): def post(self): &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name name = body.get(&#39;name&#39;) if name is None or len(name) &lt; 2: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Name is missing, or is less than 2 characters&#39;}, 400 # validate uid uid = body.get(&#39;uid&#39;) if uid is None or len(uid) &lt; 2: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;User ID is missing, or is less than 2 characters&#39;}, 400 # look for password and dob password = body.get(&#39;password&#39;) dob = body.get(&#39;dob&#39;) &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(name=name, uid=uid) &#39;&#39;&#39; Additional garbage error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # set password if provided if password is not None: uo.set_password(password) # convert to date type if dob is not None: try: uo.dob = datetime.strptime(dob, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date() except: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Date of birth format error {dob}, must be mm-dd-yyyy&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {name}, either a format error or User ID {uid} is duplicate&#39;}, 400 . explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list. The &quot;uo&quot; object, after it is created contains data from the user input, as well as a method to Create, `uo.create() a record in the table. The object both stores data and activates code. | Additionally, there is a method to set the password, uo.set_password(password). This method abstracts complexity of password encryption. | Also, there is a method to set the date of birth, uo.dob = datetime.strptime(dob, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date(). Behind the scenes this calculates an age attribute for the user. | Ultimately, after object is generated and all data is verified, the uo.create() method is called and a new row is committed into the database table. In this step, all the commands required to interact with the SQL database have been abstracted into the &quot;uo&quot; object. | There are ways to write the class User code differently! Primarly to make the code into a imperative sequence and perform everything done within the object into a serialized form of commands. However, this would minimize the possibilities for code reuse. For instance, in a User Management System there would be a need to Update user records, as well as the described Create user functionality. The User class and creating a uo object could contain leveraged methods to support Update functionality. For instance, the same password and dob mutator/setter methods would work for update. Thus, an Update API would be able to use these abstracted methods with similar code. | The concept of passing a list of Key/Value pairs through JSON, as illustrated with body variable is a foundation piece for REST API development. | The concept of creating/updating a user object (uo) is common to Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This enables the management of an Object (ie user object), which is a list or series of data elements, along with the code to mutate and access that data in a reusable and reliable object. All things in code can be done in alternative ways, but OOP is great way to manage complexity on a list of attributes describing a User. | Any additions to attributes managed in User class would require code additions, but the places of addition is well defined, ordered, and understood by the developer. Key methods like uo.create() would not be changed. | After data creation, objects from the class can be used for a mariad of other purposes. Obtaining a Database List or Collection using the User Class with its database properties allow for things like querying the data. In API preparation there is a need for code that returns a response of all uo objects to the frontend. | . | . &quot;&quot;&quot; Method that returns all User Objects to frontend &quot;&quot;&quot; def get(self): users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [uo.read() for uo in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, specific to APIs with response and dat . ROW 4. Procedural Abstraction . In a user system there is a need to store a password. However, it is not appropriate to store a password without encryption. This requires Procedural Abstraction. . includes two program code segments:- one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure. - See code for Procedural Abstraction for abstracting password hashing below. . - the code fragment below shows a procedure that sets the password in the user object self._password. It receives a parameter password from the caller of the method. - the password is hashed before it is saved in the object using generate_password_hash method. this method is part of the ***werkzeug.security*** library. - the library suppors encryption of a password into ***sha256 hashed*** password as a result . one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. See code for Procedural Abstraction fragments for calling password hashing below OR see this code in full context in Code Segment for Managing Complexity above | the uo.set_password(password) is prefaced with setting up password in lines before the call. The password is one attribute in the larger User object. | the password is initially obtained from input | this input password is passed as a parameter to the User objects set_password method as shown in the code. This results in plain text password be hashed and stored in the self._password variable within the object. | . | . | describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. . a User System requires a password to validate identity of the user | the set_password method is focussed on supporting the user identity securely | a second method def is_password(self, password): is added below to support authentication. This method is used actually validate identity. This method has a dependency that the hashed password is stored, it compares the password passed as a paramter versus the hashed password retained in the object (self._password). It returns true if passwords match, otherwise it returns false. | together the set and is methods can be used to manage passwords and validate identity of the users | . | . &quot;&quot;&quot; Procedural Abstraction for abstracting password hashing &quot;&quot;&quot; # update password, this is conventional setter def set_password(self, password): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create a hashed password.&quot;&quot;&quot; self._password = generate_password_hash(password, method=&#39;sha256&#39;) # check password parameter versus stored/encrypted password def is_password(self, password): &quot;&quot;&quot;Check against hashed password.&quot;&quot;&quot; result = check_password_hash(self._password, password) return result . &quot;&quot;&quot; Procedural Abstraction fragments for calling password hashing &quot;&quot;&quot; from flask import request # Dependencies for object creation body = request.get_json() name = body.get(&#39;name&#39;) uid = body.get(&#39;uid&#39;) uo = User(name=name, uid=uid) # Dependencies for obtaining password from user input password = body.get(&#39;password&#39;) &#39;&#39;&#39; Call to set_password method &#39;&#39;&#39; uo.set_password(password) . ROW 5. Algorithm Implementation . The most highly visible algorithm in this program is the code that displays the users table in HTML. This contains all the elements required:sequencing, selection, iteration requirements of this Algorithm. . includes a program code segment of a studentdeveloped algorithm that includes See code for Algorithm Implementation, program code segment below. | sequencing: this function has a order | selection: .catch, and if are all selection conditions | iteration: a for loop is used to display all users | . | . explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it. the function defines the algorithm is called read_users() which has the purpose of displaying all users in the database table. | in JavaScript, the fetch() method is used to make a request to the server, this begins the sequence var url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/users&quot; is the endpoint for API | method: GET means that we intend to retrieve information | mode: cors states that API is cross origin | Content-Type: application/json describes how we are passing and receive data | . | in JavaScript, the response of the fetch(), using GET method contains status and data. This continues the sequence and will move to portion of algorithm where select and iteration are used. response.status contains valid respone 200, or all other respones. | the selection statement if (response.status !== 200) { traps all normal error conditions and builds an HTML container to display those errors to user. Normal errors are handled by endpoint, such as invalid date. | the .catch at bottom of procedure is another type of selection statement that traps all errors that are unexpected. This would be errors that do not reach the endpoint, such as server being down. | passing by the guards allows the sequence of code to progress to response.json().then(data =&gt; {. This is a lamda expression that extracts the data and enables JavaScript to load the information that is returned by the server onto the web pages. | the iteration statement for (let row in data) { extracts each row from the data. The row is JSON and work as key/value pairs. | each iteration will make a call to add_row(data[row]); which loads the data from that row on screen | To view add_row() functions see Algorithm Implementation, code segement execulted within iteration below. | . | . | . /* Algorithm Implementation, program code segment */ // Display User Table, data is fetched from Backend Database var url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/users&quot; function read_users() { // prepare fetch options const read_options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; }, }; // fetch the data from API fetch(read_fetch, read_options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database read error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will have json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); for (let row in data) { console.log(data[row]); add_row(data[row]); } }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); } . /* Algorithm Implementation, code segement execulted within iteration */ function add_row(data) { const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const uid = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const posts = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;) const dob = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const age = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // obtain data that is specific to the API uid.innerHTML = data.uid; name.innerHTML = data.name; posts.innerHTML = data.posts.length; dob.innerHTML = data.dob; age.innerHTML = data.age; // add HTML to container tr.appendChild(uid); tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(posts); tr.appendChild(dob); tr.appendChild(age); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } . ROW 6. Testing . The frontend makes two HTTP method calls (post, get) to the backend API endpoint. A single API endpoint is defined in the clase UserAPI it is at the bottom of code sequence api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;). The supported backend methods post(self), get(self) can be found inside of the class _CRUD(Resource):. . describe two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. See First endpoint fetch, HTTP POST function create_user() below. | See Second endpoint fetch, HTTP POST function read_users() below. | Both calls are using same JavaScript fetch url endpoint variable url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/users&quot;, but activate different HTTP methods as options. The HTTP methods are activated by API selection login in the backend of the API controller/definition. | The first call has a data structure (user input) in body and uses thePOST option aas its HTTP method. | The second call sends the GET option as its HTTP method. | . | . describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. . See Single API endpoint class UserAPI below, containing api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;) | The first, API POST method, is directed to the Python Restful API resourcedef post(self): within the class _CRUD(Resource). This Creates a new row in the backend database. | The second, API GET method, is directed to the Python Restful API resourcedef get(self): within the class _CRUD(Resource). This Reads data from the backend database. | . | identifies the result of each call. . The first, creates a record and performs return jsonify(user.read()) which contains the newly created user row. Alternately, it could return one of several errors, for instance return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;User ID is missing, or is less than 2 characters&#39;}, 400 based off of an invalid User ID input. On succesfull return the data is loaded and displayed by the JavaScript Web server | The second, produces a list of users from a database query users = User.query.all(), turns the query into a Python list, using list comprenhension json_ready = [user.read() for user in users].

The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a ___. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is ___. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # .

The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. .

Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . Hacks .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

            "content": "Flask Security using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)) . Geeks | Reference | Real Python | . JWT concepts via ChatGPT with added illustrations . To implement a JWT-based authentication system with a JavaScript frontend and a Python Flask backend, you can follow these steps: . JSON Web Token (JWT) is a popular way to authenticate users in a web application. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS). Here is an example of how you might use JWT for authentication in a JavaScript application: . Frontend: In the JavaScript frontend, you can use the fetch API to send a request to the backend with the user credentials. The client sends a login request to the server with the user’s credentials (e.g., username and password). On a successful login, the backend returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the frontend can store in local storage. Frontend/Client/Origin: https://myclient.github.io | Backend/Server/Host: flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . | Backend: On the Python Flask backend, you can write an API endpoint that accepts the user credentials, verifies them, and returns a JWT. You can use a library such as PyJWT to encode and decode the JWT. If the credentials are valid (CORS, cross-site, etc), the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client. Here ae some samples of required credentials. Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors | Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site | . | Frontend: The client stores the JWT in a cookie. For subsequent requests, the frontend can send the JWT in the Authorization header, allowing the backend to verify the authenticity of the request. Here is cookie in Chrome Inspect properties | Sample Cookie. jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqbTEwMjFAZ21haWwuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc1ODA0MTg2LCJpYXQiOjE2NzU3ODYxODZ9.rHoLxTcBJOBv36gH5qNI1VhgGv2Jub1OPtpddf1-fHd84BcL5MeGxiBhi2M0MpEJcuhTjeC2TYWVaOjT7ek0tg; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; Expires=Tue, 07 Feb 2023 17:09:46 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None; Secure | . | Backend: On the backend, you can write code that checks the JWT in the Authorization header on every incoming request. If the JWT is valid, the backend determine the identity of the user and allows the request to proceed. Here is successful response. | . | Frontend: When the user logs out, the frontend needs to remove the JWT. | A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.). The first part is the header, which specifies the algorithm used to sign the JWT (e.g., HS256). The second part is the payload, which contains the claims. The third part is the signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way. . It is important to use HTTPS when transmitting JWTs to ensure that the JWT is not intercepted by an attacker. It is also a good idea to use short-lived JWTs (e.g., with an expiration time of one hour) and to refresh them frequently to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. . Storing JWT . There are a few different options for storing a JWT in a JavaScript application: . Cookies: You can store the JWT in a cookie and send it back to the server with each request. This is a simple and widely-supported option, but it has some limitations. For example, you can’t access cookies from JavaScript on a different domain, and some users may have cookies disabled in their browser settings. | Local storage: You can store the JWT in the browser’s local storage (localStorage) or session storage (sessionStorage). This option allows you to access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, but it is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into your application and steal the JWT from the storage. | HttpOnly cookie: You can store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie, which is a cookie that can only be accessed by the server and not by client-side JavaScript. This option provides some protection against XSS attacks, but it is still vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). | ChatGPT says … It is generally recommended to use a combination of options to provide the best security for your application. For example, you could store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie and also in local storage, and use JavaScript to send the JWT from local storage to the server with each request. This way, you can still access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, while also protecting against XSS attacks. . However, for implementation we we will use ** #3 HttpOnly Cookie **. . Key Configuration Areas . Nginx configuration snippet (Client to this Server): . Nginx. Focus on add_header in preflight section that allow cross domain (github.io) to access server. java location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8085; . # Preflighted requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&quot; &quot;true&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; &quot;https://myclient.github.io&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-MaxAge&quot; 600; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Content-Type, Authorization, x-csrf-token&quot;; return 200; } } . Python. JWT / Authenticate API . Python. Build an API to respond with a Cookie. This will have type, path, age, and allow for cross-origin (sameSite). .

Authenticate with JWT in a JavaScript application: . This example sends a POST request to the /authorize endpoint with the user’s credentials in the request body. If the login was successful, the server will return a 200 OK response with the JWT set to Application properties. . /// URL for deployment var url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com&quot; // Comment out next line for local testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085&quot; // Authenticate endpoint const login_url = url + &#39;/authenticate&#39;; function login_user(){ // Set body to include login data const body = { email: document.getElementById(&quot;uid&quot;).value, password: document.getElementById(&quot;password&quot;).value, }; // Set Headers to support cross origin const requestOptions = { method: &#39;POST&#39;, mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;no-cache&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit body: JSON.stringify(body), headers: { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;, }, }; // Fetch JWT fetch(login_url, requestOptions) .then(response =&gt; { // trap error response from Web API if (!response.ok) { const errorMsg = &#39;Login error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); return; } // Success!!! // Redirect to Database location window.location.href = &quot;/APCSA/data/database&quot;; }) } . You can then use the JWT for authentication in subsequent fetch requests as the browser sends JWT in the Authorization header. Here is an example, but there is ** Nothing Unique ** in this example, as client/browser send authorization to server, just make sure to capture errors. . // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare URL var url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/person/&quot;; // Uncomment next line for localhost testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085/api/person/&quot;; // set options for cross origin header request const options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, }; // fetch the API fetch(url, options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors and display if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will contain json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); for (const row of data) { // tr and td build out for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const id = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const age = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.name; id.innerHTML = row.email; age.innerHTML = row.age; // this build td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(id); tr.appendChild(age); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err + &quot;: &quot; + url; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); .

Here are the steps you can follow to configure Flask-Security to use your own user database: | Install Flask-Security and the necessary database driver. For example, if you are using PostgreSQL, you would install Flask-Security and the psycopg2 driver with the following commands: | Add to requirements.txt: Flask-Security, psycopg2-binary, Flask-JWT-Extended | Add Flask-Security extension in your Flask application: __init__py | . from flask_security import Security, SQLAlchemyUserDatastore from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, create_access_token, jwt_required app = Flask(__name__) app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = &#39;your_database_uri&#39; app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;your_secret_key&#39; app.config[&#39;JWT_SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;your_secret_key&#39; jwt = JWTManager(app) db = SQLAlchemy(app) security = Security(app, SQLAlchemyUserDatastore(db)) . This initializes the extension with a SQLAlchemyUserDatastore, which is responsible for interacting with your database. . | Define your User and Role models in your application.

The create_access_token() function creates a JWT with the user’s ID as the token’s identity. You can customize the contents of the token by passing additional parameters to the function. For example, to include the user’s email in the token, you can do: | . access_token = create_access_token(identity=user.id, additional_claims={&#39;email&#39;: user.email}) . Define a route for user authentication, where the user provides their email and password in the request body. In this example, we’ll assume that the email and password are stored in the User model we defined earlier. | . from models import User @app.route(&#39;/login&#39;, methods=[&#39;POST&#39;]) def login(): email = request.json.get(&#39;email&#39;, None) password = request.json.get(&#39;password&#39;, None) user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first() if not user or not user.check_password(password): return jsonify({&#39;message&#39;: &#39;Invalid credentials&#39;}), 401 access_token = create_access_token(identity=user.id) return jsonify({&#39;access_token&#39;: access_token}), 200 . Use the @login_required and @roles_accepted decorators to secure endpoints in your Flask views. The @login_required decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access the endpoint, while the @roles_accepted decorator ensures that only users with the specified roles can access the endpoint. | . @app.route(&#39;/protected&#39;, methods=[&#39;GET&#39;]) @jwt_required() def protected(): return jsonify({&#39;message&#39;: &#39;This is a protected endpoint!&#39;}) @app.route(&#39;/admin&#39;) @roles_accepted(&#39;admin&#39;) def admin(): return &#39;This is a secured endpoint for users with the admin role only!&#39; . Restrict access to the admin endpoint to users with the admin role, you need to create a role with the name admin and assign it to the appropriate user(s): | . # create an admin role admin_role = user_datastore.create_role(name=&#39;admin&#39;, description=&#39;Administrator&#39;) # create a user with the admin role admin_user = user_datastore.create_user(email=&#39;admin@example.com&#39;, password=&#39;password&#39;) user_datastore.add_role_to_user(admin_user, admin_role) # commit the changes to the database db.session.commit() . To implement authentication and return a JWT (JSON Web Token) in Flask, you can use the Flask-JWT-Extended extension. Here’s an example of how to implement authentication and return a JWT: | .",

Make sure to git pull before making changes . This will make sure that you pull any changes made by your team, and prevents merge conflicts . | Open terminal in VSCode and run python3 main.py (Make sure you cd into your repo) . This should give you a local address where your flask is running. Open this in your browser to see your changes live . | Make changes that are needed . Refer to your running site often to see changes as you develop . | Commit your changes locally . Do not Sync change from UI or git push from terminal yet, just Commit. It is great practice to Commit Often with sensible comments. Anytime after you commit you can pull team members changes for additional verifications. . | Before updating deployment start Docker Desktop app and test your Web Application. . Test docker-compose up or sudo docker-compose up in your VSCode terminal (don&#39;t forget to &#39;cd&#39; into the right repo). . | After Docker is done building, type in http://localhost:8 in your browser.&gt; Replace &#39;8&#39; with your port number. Review your personal changes and team members changes in running site. As long as Docker Desktop and Docker App is running, you can make little changes and save, they should refresh in site within a few seconds. Any errors, runtime errors, will appear in browser of VSCode terminal, read messages thoroughly and debug errors. Docker Desktop may consume a lot of CPU resources, if you are unplugged you may want to close it after you are done testing. . | If all goes well, Sync change from UI or git push from terminal. . If you can&#39;t push review git status from terminal. Resolve all open files git restore or git commit, then git pull and repeat steps 5 to 7. . | Pulling Changes into AWS EC2 deployment . Updates should be quick and easy, as long as your teams verifies problems on localhost prior to these steps. . In your AWS EC2 terminal; . Navigate to your repo:cd ~/my_unique_name | docker-compose downTest Server in browser using https://, it should be down (502 Bad Gateway in browser) . | git pull . | Rebuild your docker container: docker-compose up -d --build .

            "content": "What is CORS? . Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. | Its essentially a security feature | . How it goes down: . The browser(frontend) sends the GET request with an extra Origin HTTP header to service.example.com (deployed backend) containing the domain that served the parent page Origin: http://www.example.com // frontend url | The server at service.example.com sends one of these responses: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com //backend allows the frontend url to access its contents Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * //backend allows any site to access its contents | What is the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header? . The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is included in the response(response comes from backend) from site B to a request(fetch from frontend) site A, and identifies the permitted origin of the request. A web browser compares the Access-Control-Allow-Origin with the requesting website&#39;s origin and permits access to the response if they match. | Including the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the client-side request can be useful in some cases, such as when you are working with a third-party API and want to make sure that your requests are allowed by the server. | It can also be used during development or testing, when you may not have control over the server-side configuration A better model: | . Issues with CORS . When trying to start a local server and test your frontend and backend connection, cors is often something that gets in the way. | Unfortunately this error can prevent any sort of backend connection without proper code. Usually this error will appear when a header for cors is not specified or your backend url is not permitted by cors | . . I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen it... So here&#39;s a method to bypass CORS locally. Eventually, when both your frontend and backend are deployed, it&#39;s good practice to have CORS implemented since your site could have some security risk if you simply bypass it. . Local x Local . Setup local backend . How to bypass CORS with a local backend and frontend running . Run your backend locally by running the main.py file on your flask repository in vscode | Get the url of your backend server. | . Setup local frontend . run the command bundle exec jekyll serve in terminal to start your frontend locally | Use the url from the picture above to write a &#39;fetch&#39; statement (doesn&#39;t have to be like whats written below) to reference the local url and your api | . fetch(&#39;http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/yourapi/&#39;).then(function(response) { return response.json(); }); . Solution 1: Code in main.py . In the main.py file on your flask server, there should be a section of code at the bottom of the page that is already built in (by Mr. Mort) to aid in any cors errors. | It looks like this: | . if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # change name for testing from flask_cors import CORS cors = CORS(app) app.run(debug=True, host=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, port=&quot;8080&quot;) . Background info on flask_cors . flask_cors is a Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible. This package has a simple philosophy: when you want to enable CORS, you wish to enable it for all use cases on a domain. This means no mucking around with different allowed headers, methods, etc. | in simple terms, this extension allows you to avoid dealing with annoying headers and access the domains you need | . | Possible errors . &quot;module cannot be resolved&quot; cd to your repository file path | make sure you have the prefix (base) (aka type wsl) | pip install -U flask-cors | . | . | . Solution 2: Download google Extension . Good for quick testing purposes | Download this Google chrome extension: Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-origin | Toggle the extension so that its ON | . Now try interacting with your frontend site, and the fetch will work . Local x Deployed . It&#39;s worth noting that including the Access-Control-Allow-origin in the client-side(frontend repo) request does not actually enable cross-origin requests if the server(backend) is not configured to allow them. The server must still include the header in its response for the request to be allowed. | . Local Frontend . same steps as described previously to setup the local frontend. | Instead of fetching from the local url, replace it with the domain url of your backend server. | . fetch(&#39;https://finalssvgcars.duckdns.org/api/cars/&#39;).then(function(response) { return response.json(); }); . Deployed Backend . In order to get the combination of local frontend and deployed backend to work, the Access-Control-Allow-origin must be configured on the server side. And it is | Setup AWS by following the deployment guide on the APCSP Website | When you set up the nginx configuration files, you&#39;ll notice: | As you can see the header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; * is present in the nginx files in sites-available and sites-enabled | The line proxy_pass http://localhost:8777 is allowing the frontend local url to access the deployed backend site | Another thing to note however is that the &quot;&quot; allows any frontend site to access the backend. In order to secure this, you need to put something different in place of the . Will go over this in the next sections | . Deployed x Local . This combination should work identical to the Local x Local combination. Thus any solutions for that combination also apply to this combination. | . Deployed Frontend . Go to your repository on github | when you scroll down, under the section called &quot;Environment&quot;, click the link that says &quot;github pages&quot; | Then click &quot;view deployment&quot; | Your frontend deployed url should follow this format: https://username.github.io/name_of_repository/ | Your fetch statement should use the local url of the backend server (identical to that of the Local x Local combination) | .

The HTTP protocol documents the mechanism for a client to upload a file, and the Flask framework fully supports it. . Suggestion is to READ the CODE, lots of comments and start implementing. See app_content.py and the hacks in the file. Note the import secure_filename from werkzeug.utils. . A Basic File Upload Form . See content.html. From a high-level perspective, a client uploading a file is treated the same as any other form data submission. In other words, you have to define an HTML form with a file field in it. The HTML &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; defines a file-select field and a &quot;Browse&quot; button for file uploads. . An HTTP multipart request is an HTTP request that HTTP clients construct to send files and data over to an HTTP Server. It is commonly used by browsers and HTTP clients to upload files to the server.

Hacks - Mostly Research oriented . 1 add additional content . Additional Content . Video, Comma Separated Values (CSV), Code File (py,java) | Add additional capabilities to support needs of your project. Think about how to use uploads for different parts of System About Page with user specific uploads | Thumb nail for User Login | etc | . | . 2 add additional description and capabilities . Establish a database record that keeps track of content and establishes meta data versus current list implementation Combine Note and Image upload into single blueprint and MVC. Most pictures have notes and vice-versa, | Consider adding user, you may want to filter Uploads/Notes to the logged in user, this can be done within same model. | Add description to Upload, or add Image to Note. Description should be Markdown. | . | Think about easier UI for user of Note and Images uploads | . 3 establish a strategy to manage data being stored through Amazon S3 bucket . AWS S3 Object Container is a system used to manage content | AWS would replace putting Upload on local file system, but all the database features from Hack #2 would remain. | S3 Bucket Concept:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVC7uTNJX8 | .",

MVC MODEL: model.py . Password encryption is implemented in model to protect user information. . # The class that you use to represent users needs to implement these properties and methods: # is_authenticated, is_active, is_anonymous, get_id() # To make implementing a user class easier, you can inherit from UserMixin, which provides default implementations # for all of these properties and methods. from flask_login import UserMixin # Users DB is a collection Data Structure class Users(UserMixin, db.Model): # define the Users schema userID = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) name = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) email = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=True, nullable=False) password = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) phone = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes instance variables within object def __init__(self, name, email, password, phone): self.name = name self.email = email self.set_password(password) #encrypt password self.phone = phone # required for login_user, overrides id (login_user default) to implemented userID # The method get_id() must return a str that uniquely identifies this user, and can be used to load the user # from the user_loader callback. def get_id(self): return self.userID ## Hashing Passwords With Werkzeug(German word meaning Tools) &#39;&#39;&#39; Any time you want to login to a website/app, you need a password. It&#39;s very important not to store passwords as-is in a database, instead you need to do something called hashing which converts the password into a hash which is a big long string of text and characters. Hashing is the process of scrambling raw information to the extent that it cannot reproduce it back to its original form. It takes a piece of information and passes it through a function that performs mathematical operations on the plaintext. This function is called the hash function, and the output is called the hash value/digest. Hashing is nearly impossible to revert, so if hackers get a hold of a database with hashed passwords, hash decoding is a futile task. &lt;img width=&quot;520&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88572244/161413976-32b5db62-56f4-4453-99c6-658bfbb995d1.png&quot;&gt; The Secure Hash Algorithm(SHA) with a digest size of 256 bits, or the SHA 256 algorithm, is one of the most widely used hash algorithms. While there are other variants, SHA 256 has been at the forefront of real-world applications. Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. It is a WSGI toolkit that implements requests, response objects, and utility functions. This enables a web frame to be built on it.

In Mr Mortensen’s most recent years in industry, there were many Lawyers making a profession on Patents and how they can be impacted on General Public Licensing (GPL). . Qualcomm makes its money on patents, if you use GPL software you could be voiding your rights to charge for software and patents. Open Source by nature, specifically GPL, says any derivative work is free and code should be shared. Qualcomm wants all derivative work to require a royalty payment payment, also anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty. . . From synopsis.com, “Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers.” Qualcomm has had 20 technical jobs and 3 lawyers analyzing all the code produced, analyzing code for Open Source inclusion, and analyzing impact of such licenses to its ability to charge royalties for the use of their Patents. . This may sound like a simple problem, but think about the Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. Well, don’t think the Workers of Today are entirely different. In summary, it is important to know the type of software license you are copying, it could impact billions of dollars in business. . License Communities, License Types Guide . Adding and selecting a license GitHub instructions. An author, a licensor, needs to determine a license. This may result in asking… Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse? | Do I want to allow derivative works or not? | Do I want to require all derivative code to be shared? | | . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal . The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain. . Open Source MIT License . This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm! This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions. Typically, the author of software with MIT License want credit. Credit could be as simple as adding the authors name in comments. . Close source means the GitHub project could be private. . Open Source GPL License . The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. . Open source means the GitHub project must be public. . For a company like Qualcomm, they are required to institute many practices to deliver their code in parts (public vs private). Isolating their patent and secret code, far away from the GPL or Creative Commons code. In fact, a company that is protecting their patents may need to division engineers, split distribution, not deploy to public, etc. After distribution, the customer of the Patented (ie Qualcomm) product is required to put the public/private domain code back together again. . Legal and Ethically . We need to comply with the terms of licenses. We need to cite sources. (I am particularly bad with internet pictures. However, in the picture of the Black Duck above I am actually advertising the Company). . As consumers, we have become aware that Music and Movie companies own content. These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. Most of us buy subscriptions to services. However, some figure out ways to bypass systems and allow download. Often we will see these sites disappear, as they are illegal. . In software, it can be more complicated to understand all the Creative Commons licenses and its impact to our own ideas and businesses. Mostly, if we use things in class, there is “no problem” with Open Source as our usage is considered educational use. Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class. However, Individuals and Companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license. . Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software. They had to! This was in the terms of the licenses they were using, GPL. However, as an early pioneers in Linux distributions, they established a business model around buying their support agreement. They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO). Many, many vendors have followed the Red Hat model in building free distributions and establishing unique business models. Qualcomm figured out how to mix Patent and GPL businesses and have flourished since abandoning all proprietary, to include Android in its very complicated business model using Android. . Creative Commons, Open Source are free terminologies! However, businesses will not last without income. And today, businesses won’t last without engineers pulling Open Source software. .

He built empires, led raids, and submerged himself in a fantasy world that seemingly fulfilled his every need. Meanwhile, his real life was virtually nonexistent. He neglected his schoolwork, relationships, health, even his hygiene. “I never saw my real friends. I gained weight, became lazy, and spent nearly all of my time slumped over my computer,” says Rosner, who played up to 18 hours a day, every day, for nearly two years. “When you become one of the top players in a game like World of Warcraft, tens of thousands of players are essentially under you, so you become like a virtual god” | For Rosner, gaming was detrimental. His grades suffered, he missed assignments, and he almost failed to complete his first year of college. After turning away from the game, Rosner found other sources of pleasure. He joined a gym, started DJing at his university, and became much more active socially. “I couldn’t believe what I had been missing,” he says. Ironically, World of Warcraft led Rosner to achieve his dream of making films. His documentary, IRL — In Real Life, chronicles his adventures and how he learned to break free from gaming.

Control/API concepts are receiving and API request and returning a response. . Define API flask objects (api/user.py). Flask contains object that help in API definition.2.

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

View/Blog Concepts . A notes/blog would be created to add Notes between students and teacher, part of original concept. Notes could be used for many types of applications.

In this design, most recent messages are on top | Messages are intended to support markdown and inclusion of images | Think about technique to format images in conjunction with Text | . . Hacks . Build and correlate a technical design between frontend view and backend model. This blog is focussing on frontend view., and visual concepts on how CRUD operations are presented to user of system. This particular Jupyter Notebook and code within it are used to help establish technical ideas. Start a design for your project... . Each project must have a View (as pictured) and Model (json data is fetched into the View). Describe your project. | Describe your View. Use Markdown, HTML, UML, other visuals, tables are used to characterize a project. This shows the Teacher and Graders understanding of planning Model and View. | Transition from pure design and start inserting code elements, like inputs. Also, try build a table with json data versus fetching data. | Issues should discuss problems/challenges, in Teacher/Student data here are a couple ... This design will have many JavaScript actions, at least one for each CRUD operation. In this design, developer needs think of JavaScript functions to replace placeholder alerts in example code above. | There can be different roles for CRUD operations. For instance, student will only interact with their own account. Teacher may interact with many accounts. | Given these CRUD operations what kind of APIs are needed? They should map closely button/on click actions, as each action will fetch or manipulate data differently. | . | . Extra Credit. Student(s) could assist in rework of my Flask project from last year into a Frontend / Backend solution.

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

In this design phase, Corporate User Experience designers would create concepts of what that system would look like. As a second phase, I would give those concepts to Frontend Designers that would put the concepts into code with motion. We are trying to simulate these steps through Markdown, a little HTML, images, etc. In this process, we can build a concept of a system, prior to having functional code behind the scenes, aka JavaScript, APIs, Backend. | . Build GitHub pages SASS files . Build and explore the output of scss. . | Build per instruction in Project README bundle exec jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0 -P 4002 | . | After you do this, make sure .gitignore blocks ### Jekyll ### _site .sass-cache .jekyll-cache .jekyll-metadata . | Explore output CSS, for example look at customization for h1, h2, … _site/assets/css/style.css | . | Look at other assets, see all the work that goes into Style. Learn to leverage off of it. Learn to customize on top of it using SASS tips in the blog. | . Stylesheet Notes from Midnight Theme . Altering GitHub theme and adding custom styles: . Create a file called /assets/css/style.scss in your site | Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown: @import &quot;minima&quot;; . | Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you’d like immediately after the @import line | Note: If you’d like to change the theme’s Sass variables, you must set new values before the @import line in your stylesheet. . Layouts Notes from Midnight Theme . If you’d like to change the theme’s HTML layout: . For some changes such as a custom favicon, you can add custom files in your local _includes folder. The files provided with the theme provide a starting point and are included by the original layout template. | For more extensive changes, copy the original template from the theme’s repository(Pro-tip: click “raw” to make copying easier) | Create a file called /_layouts/default.html in your site | Paste the default layout content copied in the first step | Customize the layout as you’d like | Welcome to SASS . SASS helps process a SASS file and compile it like the usual CSS file. Using SASS let’s us leverage off of a lot of implementation that has already been performed, such as GitHub pages. But it also lets you more programmatically build CSS. . . SASS Prerequisites . Skip downloads section unless you have issues. . Downloads / Command Prompt Lines . Check for npm --version to verify install, or download node.js here (just download the LTS version). . | This line of code is just used to check that you actually have npm installed, if not run installer : npm --version . | Next you will use check for sass : npm view sass version . | Install sass if required : npm install -g sass . | . SASS Tips . Features / Functionality . As the great thing about scss is that it writes the css for you, making it much less tedious. There are many aspects as to why it actually simplifies the process. | . Aspect 1: Partials . Sass naturally transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly. Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials and they allow you to work in a much more organized space. | . Aspect 2: Defining Colors / Variables . Rather than retyping the hexadecimal values of each color every single time, you can define all of the ones you want to use in a partial and then just reference them with $[color] when you want to use it. However, make sure you import the partial into the scss file where you are going to use it in. $light: #f7f7f7; $dark: #222121; $lime: #00cc66; $orangeRed: #fb4b4e; $blue: #2541b2; . | Example shown here: .navbar { background: $light; // see how instead of having to retype the hexadecimal, I can just reference it like this WOWOW so COOL height: 80px; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 0.5rem calc((100vw - 1200px) / 2); z-index: 10; position: relative; . | . Aspect 3: Nested Styling . Another unique aspect about scss is that you can actually nest styles, so if you want an aspect like let’s say color to apply to everything you are working on for that portion of the html, you can actually nest the rest of the formatting, animations, etc within that definition. | Implementation shown here with the Hero section in student scss: .hero { background-color: $light; // see how the rest of the code is indented / nested within .hero &amp;__container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; align-items: center; justify-items: center; margin: 0 auto; height: 90vh; z-index: 1; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; padding-right: 24px; padding-left: 24px; @include tablet { // @include tablet and @include mobile will be explained next grid-template-columns: 1fr; height: 100%; } &amp;--left { width: 100%; line-height: 1.2; @include tablet { padding: 5rem 0; } @include mobile { line-height: 1.5; } } &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } &amp;--left p { font-size: 2rem; color: $dark; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--btn { font-size: 1rem; background-color: $lime; padding: 14px 32px; border: none; border-radius: 4px; color: $light; margin-top: 2rem; cursor: pointer; position: relative; transition: all 0.3s; outline: none; } &amp;--btn a { position: relative; z-index: 2; color: $light; text-decoration: none; } &amp;--btn:after { // code animates home page button so that it transitions to red when hovered position: absolute; content: &#39;&#39;; top: 0; left: 0; width: 0; height: 100%; background: $orangeRed; transition: all 0.3s; border-radius: 4px; } &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100%; } &amp;--right { text-align: center; } &amp;--img { height: 100%; width: 100%; } } } . | You can see how this code works in tandem with the Hero section of the HTML, the class definitions are associated with every definition of styling coded above: | . &lt;!-- Hero HTML, each of the classes here correspond to what&#39;s defined above in the scss &lt;div class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--left&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;College Apps Are Coming!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Be Prepared&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sign up now to join the list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;hero__container--btn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--right&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;images/img-2.svg&quot; class=&quot;hero__container--img&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; --&gt; . Aspect 4: Easily Change Formatting Based on Device . With the power of scss, you can more easily than ever change the formatting of your site based on which device a person is using. | Such can be done by defining the resolutions in a partial like here: | . &lt;!-- @mixin tablet { @media screen and (max-width: 768px) { @content; } } @mixin mobile { @media screen and (max-width: 280px) { @content; } } --&gt; . Then you can use @include to reference these resolutions and change the css/formatting based on the device like here: | . &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { // in this case the font size changes because it&#39;s mobile font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } . Aspect 5: Extending, Inheritance, and Calculations . In scss, you can also use @extend if you want certain classes to inherit attributes from previously defined classes, sort of similar to nesting inheritance (where the classes nested within inherit the attributes from outermost classes). An example is shown below: | . &lt;!-- %align-center { display: flex; align-items: center; } logo { color: $dark; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; font-size: 2rem; margin-left: 24px; @extend %align-center; //it&#39;s inheriting the above values for display and align:items } --&gt; . Furthermore, you can actually use math operators like multiplication, addition, subtraction and division in scss. In the code below I use it to extend the animation of a button: &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100% * 4; //makes the animation extend way farther, past the border of the button } . | .

Jobs . Quality 1st and Creativity/Features 2nd will be the keys to 2nd Trimester points. Each team role needs to establish goals. To improve software it is important that all parties in the project have full understanding of requirements through fluid communication channels. Thus, establishing a development plan is a requirement. Here are some ideas … . Feature Focus keep an up to date blog/readme on the features of your project. The focus is to have 4 to 5 major features and the team should keep an up to date status of the progress of those features. This includes how each feature meets all the criteria of College Board Create Task. | Scrum Master should have Team Member Issues and Customer/Teacher/Grader review ticket always in plan. The review ticket should line up with Quality and Feature Focus. Scrum Master maintain features/quality plan and holds team members accountable to plan. Think about Scrum Board, README, and Issues as key artifacts to plan. | DevOps should have CI/CD goals. Process should be able to identify failures when the occur and by what change. | Backend Developer should have tester methods that don’t depend on Frontend code or later CI/CD process to catch errors. Make sure key features are working in backend. | Frontend Developer should establish full system checks before reviews. Don’t be that guy that says, “it worked last time I tried it”.

            "content": "Unit 3.9 . 3.9.1 Algorithms (Claire) lecture style, fluid . A little review on Algorithms: . what are the three components of an algorithm? . sel__ | seq__ | it___ | . Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 93: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 93: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Nice! . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Wow! Good job! . Why is this important? . When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . go to school! . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True # setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier) driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday if driveSchool == False: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) if driveSchool == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional . don&#39;t go to school! . Hacks . why is it important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing and that algorithms that look the same might have different results?(0.15) | for the converted conditional to boolean conversion(0.10) | total: 0.25 | . 3.9.2 Developing Algorithms (Annika) very quite, asked basic question, shared float chart and natural language . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): print(pretzel) pretzel -= 1 print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . 6 5 4 3 2 1 All done! . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . The parking rate is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 4+ hours: $12 How many hours have you parked at this garage? 2.0 hours costs: $8 Have a good day! . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | . 3.9.3 Using preexisting algorithms (Grace) . very fast, topic could have python . Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. . DISPLAY (&quot;Choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT () REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0 ) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- n * 3 + 1 } . Hacks . Fix the number guessing game . Make a flow chart for the algorithm number guessing game | Make a function that gets the user guess | Modify the existing search function to give more encouraging feedback | import random #sets variables for the game num_guesses = 0 user_guess = 0 upper_bound = 100 lower_bound = 0 #generates a random number number = random.randint(1,100) # print(number) #for testing purposes print(f&quot;I&#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 100.&quot;) #Write a function that gets a guess from the user using input() def guess(): #add something here return #add something here #Change the print statements to give feedback on whether the player guessed too high or too low def search(number, guess): global lower_bound, upper_bound if guess &lt; number: print(&quot;You are bad at guessing&quot;) #change this lower_bound = guess elif guess &gt; number: print(&quot;You suck :(&quot;) #change this upper_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound while user_guess != number: user_guess = guess() num_guesses += 1 print(f&quot;You guessed {user_guess}.&quot;) lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess) print(f&quot;Guess a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.&quot;) print(f&quot;You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!&quot;) . Unit 3.11 Binary Search (Claire) . Binary Search: . repeatedly dividing a search interval in half . Binary Search Steps: . first put the numbers in order ascending | descending | . | find the middle number first this is found by taking the highest index number plus the lowest index number and divide by 2 | the numbers on the right will be greater and the numbers on the left will be smaller | this can be represented with a binary tree middle number with the smaller number branched off on the left and bigger numbers branched off on the right | . | . | these lists are not always numbers lists can be made with strings | ex. [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;peach&quot;, &quot;watermelon&quot;] | alphabetical order a-z | z-a | . | . | . Practice: . What is the middle number in a Binary Search given the following set of numbers in order: 1, 5, 19, 44, 89 | What is the middle number in a Binary Search given the following set of numbers that are not in order: 3, 87, 12, 66, 22 | Hacks: . calculate the middle index and create a binary tree for each of these lists 12, 14, 43, 57, 79, 80, 99 | 92, 43, 74, 66, 30, 12, 1 | 7, 13, 96, 111, 33, 84, 60 | . | Using one of the sets of numbers from the question above, what would be the second number looked at in a binary search if the number is more than the middle number? | Which of the following lists can NOT a binary search be used in order to find a targeted value? . a. [&quot;amy&quot;, &quot;beverly&quot;, &quot;christian&quot;, &quot;devin&quot;] . b. [-1, 2, 6, 9, 19] . c. [3, 2, 8, 12, 99] . d. [&quot;xylophone&quot;, &quot;snowman&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;, &quot;doorbell&quot;, &quot;author&quot;] . | Rubric: . All 4 hacks are graded the same way . 0.25/0.25 - shows full understanding of the lesson, completes all hacks assigned with explanation to go above and beyond, any extra hacks to show more understanding . 0.23/0.25 - shows understanding of algorithms/binary search and completes all hacks . 0.20/0.25 - does not understand algorithm/binary search and has not completed hacks .",

Math in Binary . Learn binary by bitwise operators and more. Shifting bits is a common computer operation and does wonderful things in math like multiply and divide. Last bit always determines odd or even. Look for shift on w3schools . Logic of Shift . Explore right and left shifts with binary numbers. . In an arithmetic shift, the bits that are shifted out of either end are discarded. | In a left arithmetic shift, zeros are shifted in on the right. | . Understand binary Numbers by elaboration of Shift (2^^0, 2^^1, 2^^2) . How does the Power of 2 work? What is a binary number? What is Base2, Base10, Base16. . This example uses an 8-bit register. Math can be represented in much in many more bits, 32 bits or 2 bytes is common for integer in modern computer languages. | Most Significant Bit (MSB), least (LSB) | This example shows negative and positive numbers, using technique called Twos Complement. | In the first case, the leftmost digit was shifted past the end of the register, and a new 0 was shifted into the rightmost position. Positive Multiply. | In the second case, the rightmost 1 was shifted out, and a new 1 was copied into the leftmost position, preserving the sign of the number. Negative Divide, this example obviously needs more study. | . UI Concept/Design . Conceptualize on a UI that will illustrate binary and decimal. In learning these concepts, it is best to code and example to illustrate what is happening. . n Right Shifts (divides by 2^n); n Left Shifts (multiplies by 2^n) | Add buttons for “«” and “ »” | . ASCII and Unicode . Computers represent more than Math. Mostly everyone is familiar with the characters on a keyboard and Emojis. These are all represented in binary, the data abstraction being the characters we visualize. 😂 . Character Data Abstraction . How are characters stored? How many bits do they take? . ASCII is 8 bits, it generally represent keys on keyboard. Look up ASCII Table. | Unicode can be UTF-8, 16 or 32, each representing bits. ASCII is preserved in Unicode. | ASCII - 7 bits, extended to 8 bits with Unicode | UTF-8 | UTF-16 | UTF-32 Sample of Unicode characters. | . UI Concept/Design . The ASCII value in picture should be change based off of the bits in evaluation you are doing. Bits displayed, label, and evaluation would be specific to evaluation type: Original ASCII .

A logic gate can have two inputs (a,b) and by how changing these inputs it impacts the output(c). . There are four possible inputs: 0 0 | 0 1 | 1 0 | 1 1 | . | Understanding the output enables us to understand a logical expressions. All outputs are routed in Logic Gates (similar to how a language is routed in Latin). AND is true for 1 1; NAND is true opposite of AND 0 0, 0 1, 1 0 | OR is true for 1 1, 0 1, 1 0, NOR is true opposite of OR 0 0 | XOR is true for 0 1, 1 0 | . | . Practical Application .

There are always opportunities to show understanding of coding. This weekend I was observing World-O-Meter. How would you do this with our group projects. . Step 1 - JavaScript document element updates . Below is a code segment that updates a clock on a page every second, adaptation would be to update data from API fetch on an interval, then updating all document elements after fetch. . // Clock Control // clockElement global element set for convenience let clockElement = document.getElementById(&#39;clock&#39;) // Execute clock function on load clock(); // Clock update executes on each interval set by timer function clock() { let date = new Date(); clockElement.textContent = date.toLocaleString(); } // Clock refresh timer, a reoccurring event setInterval(clock, 1000); . Step 2 - JavaScript update backend content . To make the updates document elements meaningful you would need to have an interval to update the Haha or Boohoo content. This could be done in same or different JavaScript timer. This would be calling appropriate fetch in add to the counters. Together, these would give the same effect as the World-O-Meter. . Step 2 (Python Option) - update backend content . Instead of having frontend update counter, you could have backend update the counter. The below could be adapted to purpose. . import threading # import threading def keepUpdating(): # build a function to run over and over # global variable setup global run try: run except: run = 0 print(&quot;Seconds:&quot;, run) # replace this line with updates to data run += 3 # this is update to global variable threading.Timer(3.0, keepUpdating).start() keepUpdating() # you need to call this function at application startup . Step 2 (Bash Option) - do updates on server . Update content using curl and scheduling on the system. To make a PUT request with Curl, you need to use the -X PUT command-line option. . $ curl -X PUT localhost:8080/api/like/1 . This command would need to be added to crontab or a bash script and crontab to run repeatedly. . $ crontab -l # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron. # # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line # indicating with different fields when the task will be run # and what command to run for the task .

Designing an algorithm often requires you to learn the Tech first and then consider how you design your code and algorithms. Code design can take many iterations. . Truth Tables . My topic for this blog is Truth Tables. The illustration that follows displays the results of logical operators AND, OR, XOR, NOT versus binary 1 and 0. The output produces a &#39;Truth Table&#39;. . . Exploring Truth Tables operations . Exploration of this topic requires searching the language for logical operators, then figuring out how to display condition and test result. . Bitwise operations for Truth Tables typically represent 1 - True and 0 - False. | Logical expression in iteration and selection statements result in True or False | . My objective is Truth Tables. But in my exploration I did both Truth Table and Expression syntax . print(&quot;OR&quot;) print( &quot;1 | 0 = &quot;, 1 | 0) print( &quot;~(1 | 0) = &quot;, ~(1 | 0) % 2) # 1 is an integer, not a bit so remainder (modulo) does trick print(&quot;AND&quot;) print( &quot;1 &amp; 0 = &quot;, 1 &amp; 0) print( &quot;~(1 &amp; 0) = &quot;, ~(1 &amp; 0) % 2) # modulo again print(&quot;XOR&quot;) print( &quot;1 ^ 1 = &quot;, 1 ^ 1) print() # Boolean Tests print(&quot;Boolean OR&quot;) print( &quot;True or False = &quot;, True or False) print(&quot;Boolean AND&quot;) print( &quot;True and False = &quot;, True and False) print(&quot;Boolean XOR&quot;) print( &quot;True != True = &quot;, True != True) .

This algorithm focuses on small reusable procedures/functions (def) for bitwise tests. From the exploratory experience above it seems like a lot of typing would be necessary to represent possibilities. . import operator # functions for all comparisons, logical operations, mathematical operations and sequence operations # builds truth table def truth_options(): a_opts = [1, 0] b_opts = [1, 0] return [(a, b) for a in a_opts for b in b_opts] # double for permutes options # provides equivalent function lookup for bitwise using operator functions def bitwise_options(op): ops = {&#39;&amp;&#39;: operator.and_, &#39;|&#39;: operator.or_, &#39;^&#39;: operator.xor} return ops[op] # control/eval for bitwise operators, selection is based on number of operators def bitwise_eval(op, op2=&quot;&quot;): if op2 == &quot;&quot;: op_func = bitwise_options(op) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{a} {op} {b} is {op_func(a, b)}&quot;) else: op2_func = bitwise_options(op2) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{op}({a} {op2} {b}) is {(1, 0)[op2_func(a, b)]}&quot;) # opposite: index 0 returns 1, index 1 return 0 def method1(): bitwise_eval(&quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NAND&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NOR&quot;, &quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;^&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 1 *****&quot;) method1() . ***** Method 1 ***** Bitwise &amp; 1 &amp; 1 is 1 1 &amp; 0 is 0 0 &amp; 1 is 0 0 &amp; 0 is 0 Bitwise NAND NAND(1 &amp; 1) is 0 NAND(1 &amp; 0) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 1) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 0) is 1 Bitwise | 1 | 1 is 1 1 | 0 is 1 0 | 1 is 1 0 | 0 is 0 Bitwise NOR NOR(1 | 1) is 0 NOR(1 | 0) is 0 NOR(0 | 1) is 0 NOR(0 | 0) is 1 Bitwise ^ 1 ^ 1 is 0 1 ^ 0 is 1 0 ^ 1 is 1 0 ^ 0 is 0 . Truth Table - Algorithm 2 . This algorithm above seemed to me to lose clarity with all the functions.

Linear Sequence of code . The order of executions is strictly from top to bottom. This is good for learning, but is typically a poor method for an Algorithm! This was my 1st exploration above. . Procedure (Function) . A Procedure is a set of code instructions that has been abstracted into logical parts. Each code abstraction is called &quot;Procedural Abstraction&quot;. . In Python, using procedures (def) means you are starting to write &quot;good&quot; code vs &quot;bad&quot; code, mostly in terms of reusability of logic. | A procedure needs to be activated or called, this is performed in the main selections above. | .

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... .

Response could be HTML or JSON. . | HTTPS takes care of secure communication between a web server and a web browser. In our deployment process we used certbot to make HTTP communication secure all the time. . | . | TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol, Internet Protocol . TPC/IP messages are broken up into small independent “packets” and sent between computers via the Internet. . | IP is responsible for “routing” each packet to the correct destination. When an IP packet is sent from a computer, it arrives at an IP router. The IP router is responsible for “routing” the packet to the correct destination, directly or via another router. . | . | Network Layer - The wireless and physical layers that move bits and bytes “11010001” across the internet. . | . . Fault Tolerence . College Board . Know how to determine if vertex of graph has more than one connection. Multiple connections, in reference to a computing device, could be considered “Fault Tolerant”. Building “Fault Tolerant” systems makes the network or internet stronger. . Understanding Computer, Routers, Systems, and Purpose are a pre-requisite to understanding Fault Tolerance systems. Regarding College Board videos, for clarification, a Router is typically used to connect computers. Here is an illustration that is very similar to the key components we have used in this class and should be familiar to those who have done deployment. | . As we are at school, using an HTTP client we request a page via LAN or Campus Network. This Network has a router and an ISP router that directs us to the public internet. | DNS is used to translate https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com to an IP address, see What’s My DNS | This targets the Web Server, the request is directed through a router to the Server running Nginx, which intern directs request to Gunicorn application hosting the Flask Website. | . Fault tolerant “routing” and “systems” on the internet is achieved by having redundancy in routing paths and computer functions. Networks and Systems become stronger because of many routes and redundancy of function. This AWS picture shows load balancing, multiple zones, redundant equipment, standby and fail over equipment and paths. This is much more than just having multiple connections, there is A LOT of planning in making fault tolerance. This is why there is such a rise in companies like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. | . . The path the TCP/IP packet will follow might be different from other packets, for instance from the same HTTP communication. The routers in the network are responsible for the right addressing, depending on traffic volume, errors in the network, etc. Since the Internet is Fault Tolerant, there are many paths to a destination, similar to Google Maps providing alternate paths when we travel. Time can be seen with Ping. Routes and time can be see with TraceRoute command… | .

A tough digital computing puzzle illustrates need for CPU/GPU power. A distributed ledger amongst multiple miners is verified to avoid fraud. The result of this distributed computing network is a new financial economy. | . . Parallel Computing - Chrome, the browser most of us use to run our Web Application is a great example of a multi process architecture. There are two primary types of processes in Chrome : the browser process and the render process. . Browser process interacts with information from internet. This has multiple functions: Web contents represents a tab within the browser. Render View manages all IPC (Inter Process Communication), for instance the HTTP actions. . | Render process is responsible for constructing a web page.

            "content": "What Are VPN’s? . Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs establish a protected network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. . How Does A VPN Work . A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online, and which can only be accessed if one’s VPN gets hacked; however, that is extremely unlikely to happen because VPN’s are very securely encrypted. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into “gibberish”. Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless. . Setting Up A VPN (MacOS) . Navigate to your browser and search for a VPN and follow the websites directions for installation | Go to “System Preferences” and then “Network” | Click on the plus sign in the bottom left corner and use the drop-down menu to choose your VPN | Fill in the details for your chosen VPN in the fields “VPN Type” and “Service Name” | Create a new VPN network and fill in your “Server Address,” “Remote ID” and “Local ID” | Enter “Authentication Settings” and add your username and password | Click “OK” and Connect your VPN | Setting Up A VPN (Windows) .

            "content": "Deployment Overview . Deploying a Web Application enables a Server and Web Application to be available to users on the Internet. Development Operations (DevOps) is understanding the tools and service used to enable the Web Application on the Internet. This process can use many different cloud services, as well as choice of many different tools. Here is an overview of what is covered in this procedure. . EC2: Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that the PUSD district has provided for their students to serve our Web Application. | GitHub: The leading open platform to share a code across the Internet. | Docker and docker-compose: Used to host a Web Application. A Docker container prepares an environment that contains the Web Application code and all the dependencies (requirements.txt for Python) Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. | Nginx: In order to find a Web Application on a server, there needs to be a process that listens for the Web Application request and directs it to the Web Application service. Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. | Certbot: Web traffic on internet is reliably served over Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (https). Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let’s Encrypt certifications. | DNS: Natively, the web works off of IP addresses. Domain Name Services (DNS) allows the assignment of a friendly name to a Web Server. This name is built into Nginx/Certbot configuration files. Freenom is the cloud service described in this blog and has been used to register the nighthawkcodingsociety.com domain. | . Key/Values required as you go through these procedures . Listed are Keys, you need to obtain “values” specific to your Web Application setup. It is important that you recognize the sample “values” as you work through these procedures, then replace them with the “values” that are specific to your Web Application use case. . GitHub HTTPS link: | IAM user: | EC2 name: | EC2 Public IPs: | DNS Name: | DNS Subdomain name(s) | Docker Port: | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: | docker-compose, docker Image name: | Nginx server file(s): | . Server Setup and Initial Deployment . Development Operations (DevOps) begins with server setup. . Amazon Web Services (AWS): Electric Cloud Compute (EC2) Setup . Preparing and AWS EC2 instance is the process of creating a cloud computer. This process starts by logging into your AWS IAM user, searching for EC2. . To get started, launch a new AWS EC2 instance to learn process and understand how to work with Linux. here are some key considerations. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the class will be using Ubuntu you should check on last verified version with a Teacher before proceeding | When it comes to picking memory or disk it is VERY important to pick Free Tier. As stated, this will only be used for testing and then it will be disposed for cost efficiency. | When presented with access dialog for http and https, make sure you check these boxes. Remember you are making a Web application that will run over http and https. | Name the security group (.pem) file after your self or team. It may be necessary to use SSH to access your EC2 instance. | The remainder of the steps you can use the defaults, refer to AWS documentation for guidance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html | At the end of this process you need to “Connect to Instance”. This will provide you a terminal like experience. | . | . Deployment Process . Deployment begins with terminal connections. It is necessary to run commands to setup files to enable your Web Application to run on the Internet. . Connect to EC2 through cloud . Connect to an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS and then begin the system and software setup. . Select your machine and press “Connect” at top middle. | On next screen ensure things are lined “EC2 Instance Connect” and press “Connect” at bottom. | Only if this fails you will need to connect from our Anaconda terminal, we need pem file so place it in your home directory. | Either connection should work at home, school WIFI may be blocking, I have been trying to get this open. A Hot spot or VPN will solve connection errors. | . Update, Upgrade, and Install packages . Terminal commands are shown, these commands will be run from Terminal after you connect to your EC2 instance. It is advised that you try to comprehend and learn these commands as you go through these procedures. Understanding steps is how you become a DevOps Engineer. . These commands update and then upgrade packages in your system. . $ sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade $ sudo apt install docker $ sudo apt install docker-compose -y $ sudo apt install html2text $ sudo apt install python3-pip nginx $ sudo pip3 install virtualenv . Clone and Change Directory to project location . This command moves your Web Application code onto you EC2 cloud computer. The example GithUb HTTPs Link is demonstration is: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git. . $ cd $ git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git $ cd flask_portfolio . Clone needs to be repeated for each Web application on the EC2 instance (Team repository and each individual repository). If repo is named the same use option parameter at the end of clone command git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git flask_portfolio_john, then cd flask_portfolio_john | . Test Web Service . These steps will require you to understand a few new commands that will not be part of final deployment process. However, these commands will help you understand machine dependencies and validate your requirements.txt for completeness. . $ cd ~/flask_portfolio $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 webapp $ source webapp/bin/activate $ pip install -r requirements.txt $ python main.py . Failed result. If you get a result that looks like the below, your requirements.txt needs work. In this instance, I would need to add flask to the requirements.txt. | .

Create Dockerfile to run Web Service . A Dockerfile is a configuration used to run the Web Service. This is placed in a file called Dockerfile. It is best to add this to VS Code and pull it, or you can update in place with nano, vi, or vim editor and use command line commands to push it into your repository. The Dockerfile should be considered Code! . Edit the Dockerfile $ sudo nano Dockerfile . | Insert the Dockerfile commands, note that they are similar to Bash commands performed earlier.

Create docker-compose file share Web Service . A docker-compose file is a configuration used to share your Docker Web Service and resources with the Linux system. This file enable Linux to have access to the container and the persistent data application via the /volumes location. . Once again it is best to add the docker-compose.yml in VS Code and pull it. You can edit it on the machine itself using vi, vim, or nano. | The image: needs to have unique name for each application on server (ie flask_john_v1) | The ports: left value 8086 needs to be unique for each application on server (ie 8087:8080, 8088:8080, etc) | Change device: to match path to volumes directory of your project.

If you are to this point you are successfully running your Web Application with Docker and verifying that it is running with Curl. | . Test preparation for Docker Web Application using IP for Internet Access . Each student scrum team will perform Nginx test and verify Group Web Project is working on EC2 instance. This step is can only support a single Web Application at a time. . This Step is dependent on… . EC2 Public IPs: 3.233.212.71 | Docker Port: 8086 | . Enable Nginx to retrieve default Web Application using IP Address from internet request (Reverse Proxy)! . Install Nginx on Ubuntu servers $ sudo apt install nginx . | Go to location of Nginx server configuration files $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available . | Open editor to Create your own “Nginx test configuration”. $ sudo nano test . | Edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications to: IP Address: 3.233.212.71 | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8086 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name 3.233.212.71; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8086; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } . Activating Nginx configuration .

This means something is wrong with EC2 Public IP. | Nginx Default page. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with you Nginx test configuration. | Broken Gateway. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with Web Application endpoint on machine. This requires you to look at port configuration OR restart Docker. | . | . Congratulations. If you have arrived at this point you now have capability to access your team Web Application from the Internet. Hurray!!! . Final preparation the Docker Web Application using DNS for Internet Access . There are additional steps to this preparation. We need to direct the internet to the AWS server running the Web Application, this is done using Domain Name Service (DNS). After being directed to the Web Server, the server needs to respond to the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) request. The proxy of HTTP to your Web Application is manged by Nginx. Finally, we will Secure HTTP (HTTPS), with a utility called Certbot. . DNS provider and setup . Each student scrum team is required to learn how to obtain a DNS provider and setup an independent domain. . A picture is included to show key elements in setting up a domain with a DNS provider. The nighthawkcodingsociety.com is using Freenom as its service provider. As you build your own DNS endpoint, you will need to obtain your own IP address mapped to a Domain. . This Freenom illustration is dependent on… . DNS Name: nighthawkcodingsociety.com | DNS Subdomain name(s): battleship.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. cowboys.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . A minimum configuration will have the two “A” type definitions using you Public IP address. These two are resolved with a single Web Application. The “CNAME” type is used for subdomains, these will resolve to a different Web Application. . Setup DNS mapping to your Public IP address now!!! This is needed to complete Nginx and Certbot configurations below. You will not be able to proceed until you have setup ‘A’ record. . . Open editor to Create your own “Nginx Web Application configuration” for your group project. This looks very similar to test configurations, but the change is the Domain names. These Domain names must be created through DNS provider and you must setup ‘A’ entries in DNS for them to work. For clarity, the name nighthawk should reflect your application name, domain or subdomain. The name needs to be unique for each web application (ie john_nighthawk for john.nighthawk.com). $ sudo nano nighthawk . | Edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications: DNS Name(s): nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8086 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8086; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } . Or, or in addition, edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications to subdomain file (0 to many). These Domain names must be created through DNS provider and you must setup ‘A’ or ‘CNAME’ entries in DNS for them to work: DNS Name(s): flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8087 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8087; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } .

Testing HTTP endpoint . Before finishing, this is a good opportunity to review everything you have done. . Make sure curl is still working on local machine. | . $ curl http://localhost:8086 $ curl http://localhost:8087 etc . Now test unsecure HTTP endpoint on the internet. Go to a browser anywhere and type your DNS domain: http://nighthawkcodingsociety.com or http://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. Timeout. This means something is wrong with EC2 Public IP. | Nginx Default page. This means DNS is working, but something is wrong with you Nginx configuration. | Broken Gateway. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with Web Application endpoint on machine, if this fails something is wrong with Web Application. This requires you to look at Docker and docker-compose configuration. | . | . Certbot install and configuration . Each student scrum team will learn Certbot on on AWS EC2 test server, establish working https web application. The final configuration will be on AWS server managed by Teachers or Student DevOps Engineers. . $ sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core $ sudo snap install --classic certbot $ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot $ sudo certbot --nginx .

            "content": ". GitHub and Git . GitHub.com was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chaco. GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018 (kind of ironic with Git quote below), but GitHub is not Git it helps manage the server or backend. . Linus Torvalds invented Linux and about 2005 invented Git. Quotes by Linus: . “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” | “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” | Microsoft isn’t evil; they just make really crappy operating systems. | . In our environments, Git is local and it works with GitHub/Git is in the cloud. Together these tools together have become an industry standard since about 2015. Formerly in industry we used tools like (ClearCase and Perforce), before the 90s we had home brewed systems. Kind of like making smart backups of files. . Terms and Usage . A brief review of key commands and concepts. . A “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git). | A .git directory contains a local database (see illustration) that keeps track of local changes. | A “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database. Git commits over time are a series of Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA’s). This is the math behind a git snapshot. | The .gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree (ie files constructed from source or derived files, like ipynb files that turn into md files). | The “git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). However, often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors. Students will experience this when they share a repository. | To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable. | Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository. | A “git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch. | . Project Based Learning . In Project Based Learning, it is required that you have a policy on Contributing Guidelines. Many student have already experienced problems of merging and managing change, by editing code GitHub directly, while editing code on VSCode locally. This will be an every day occurrence when starting a GitHub/Git sociology. Thus, teams need to create a policy to communicate how Scrum Team or Others should contribute to your project. . GitHub and VSCode | . Hacks . Any sociology questions within team need to be answered with a Blog, A Scrum Master working with other Developers should establish the Github administration/sociology policies: . What is the main repository for your project? | Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? Look at this tool for guidance. | Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base? | Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? Creating Issues | Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Create Pull Request | Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests? Link Issue to PR | Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban? Tracking Issues | .",

Project Planning . Teacher/Student need, Educational Study or Simulation, Campus Club, Campus Interest, Business Interest, Charitable Organization, etc. Of course, the greatest interest is Student Interest. The project will not work if only one student is interested. - Program Purpose and Function. Think about inputs, outputs, UI, and data that will be in the program. - Be sure to pick something that you don’t burn out on after a couple of weeks. If you are a couple days into something and it is not working it is best to change. - IMO, it is much more interesting to work on something that has 3rd party interest or that you design something with intention to acquire a 3rd party interest. Working on something to acquire accolades is a big motivator. . Begin a GitHub code base with Team. Some of ideation may come in playing with code. This could also be done in Jupyter Notebooks. | Data Abstraction. UML is pictured in article. Think about how data will be formed and managed. | Managing Complexity. Think about frontend and backend portions of the system. | Procedural Abstraction. Design some of the key objects of the system. Think about the key elements of User Design. This should help you divide work amongst team. Effectually, you will be creating the sub systems of the system in this design effort. | Algorithm Implementation. The key aspects of your project and its algorithms must be considered, prototyped early. This will help you understand capabilities of team and some of the longer/research required activities. | Testing. Be sure that you are performing iteration and testing as you go. Do not stack things up or integrate infrequently. Develop, Integrate, Test weekly!!! Also, think about the things that needs to be tested. Think about how to put data into the system auto magically to ensure quality is produced and everything is easily validated. | . Teacher Needs . PBL. Concept/Idea in CSP Education.

Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); console.log(&quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;); // Document Object Model (DOM) output; output to HTML, CSS which is standard for a Web Page // &lt;mark&gt;select element method&lt;/mark&gt;: DOM native JavaScript get, document.getElementByID document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // &lt;mark&gt;jQuery CSS-style method&lt;/mark&gt;: Tag for DOM selector, $(&#39;#output&#39;) $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); // br is break or new line, b is bold // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.text(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is output option as part of %%js magic element.append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over.

The &quot;definition of the function&quot;: &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The &quot;call to the function:&quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function...

JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(output) { console.log(getType(output)); // logs string console.info(output); // logs object element.append(getType(output) + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(output)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &lt;br&gt;&quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format .

Agile includes the 12 Principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. . . Roles . To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies (requirements.txt), AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team. If we had a two week Sprint this would be 40-48 hours of work. | Key to success. Make great use of time in class. Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when in class and you are learning something new. | . Issues . Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks. . Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style . The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals, each of these issues will have tangible deliverable links (code/video/…). Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyone’s ideas and efforts. This includes individual tasks. Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board. Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (Kanban) to represent progress. The below columns have been successful in our academic environment. . To do/backlog | In progress | Complete | Deployed | Reviewed/Done | Sprint . Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 2 weeks or longer in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | Week 2 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . 7 Important Transferable Skills . Assessments / Reviews . During Teacher reviews meetings ( 1 v 2 pair, 1 v 4 team), the pair or team will provide Teacher with a Review Ticket. The Review Ticket will be completed, it should reference Tasks Completed and Self/Crossover Score(s). Canvas and/or Points Blog should be used as a guide to completing a review ticket, make sure you account for everything. Make sure a Point total is a the TOP of ticket, as points are important to you! All assessments will be looking for these 7 elements in your work… . Creativity Creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you paint or draw or sculpt well. Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you do both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled up are big problems. Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical thinking Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results. The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. If you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | Collaboration - Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | Technical We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires.

            "content": "It’s often useful to test pages locally before deploying, as it can save time and be helpful for testing quick changes/debugging. In this blog we’ll learn how to deploy fastpages locally using Docker. . Overview of steps . Download Docker desktop | (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL | Run make server in repo directory | Click in terminal or type localhost link show (ex. http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}) to view your Fastpages Blog site. | 1. Installation . Docker is a lightweight method to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers. Download Docker desktop from following links: . Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/. . Now, each time you want to make server, you need to start Docker desktop or make sure it running. Make sure you do this before building locally! . 2. (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL . For Windows, to set up Docker with WSL use https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/. . (Optional) Download Docker extension in VSCode . VSCode has an extension too make it easier to manage docker containers and images directly in your IDE. To download, go to the Extensions tab of VSCode (left bar, or Ctrl+Shift+X), search “Docker” and download the extension from Microsoft. You should now see a docker icon on the left bar, which you can click on to see your Docker connections. . 3. Using VSCode Terminal, run: make server . In the local repository, make sure you are cd’ed to the base/root directory (i.e. where the Makefile is). For Ellen that was the ap-csa-fastpages directory as pictured. For Mr M, cd ~/vscode/APCSA sets him in his APCSA repository, here the make server command will work if Docker is running. . . The Makefile contains common aliased commands for building and serving your fastpages locally. If you look inside the file or run make in terminal, you can see what docker commands it can run. . . Specifically, we are interested in the make server command, which will build the container the first time and start the Jekyll server. If you remember from APCSP, Jekyll is what powers Github pages behind the scenes. You can build your GitHub Pages site locally using Jekyll to preview and test changes to your site. . Special steps for Windows . The first time, you might get this issue: . . If that’s the case, make sure this setting is toggled on in Docker desktop settings: . . It should ask you to reload and if you run the command again it should work now. . 4. View blog . After running, look for link to run Server. For me, this was http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}: . Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/ . Server running… press ctrl-c to stop. . Shift-click server address to launch in Browser. . Leave the server running!!! . Make edits in VSCode and save the file. On each save, watch terminal in VSCode to see updates and regeneration of WebSite. . Refresh or click to Web page of change and you will see updates almost instantly. Refer to VSCode terminal to see any error encountered when running your server. As indicated ctrl-c will stop the server, however, I have left it running for hours of edits, testing, and commits to GitHub. . Alert, when you are satisfied with local changes… you must ✔️Commit and Sync to GitHub. The local server is used to preview and test change prior to Sync. Only after Sync, will others be able to see your changes. . . Add to .gitignore . A side effect of building locally is that it converts all the .ipynb and .docx files to .md. This means that some files will have duplicates after building – one in .ipynb or .docx, another in .md form. . To avoid duplicates masters when pushing to github, add the md generated files from to the .gitignore. This can be done by right clicking md file when preparing commits. Below is a sample .gitignore. The 1st three lines should be universal to all fastpages projects, the other files are specific to your project. . # Ignore from local build settings.ini Gemfile.lock images/copied_from_nb/ _posts/2022-08-15-AP-anatomy.md _posts/2022-08-22-HM-anthony_and_sahil.md _posts/2022-08-22-TT-darkmode.md _posts/2022-08-22-AP-primitives.md _posts/2022-08-22-TT-bash_tutorial.md _posts/2022-08-29-AP-using_java_objects.md _posts/2022-09-05-AP-boolean_ifs.md _posts/2022-09-19-TT-js_tutorial.md _posts/2022-09-26-TT-rapidapi.md .

They’re videos are super quick and straight to the point, which was good for relearning topics I already knew but needed a refresh on. For example, bits and binary was something that I couldn’t remember from the beginning of the year, and the videos helped me remember the basics. | They have assignments/articles for each topic that basically restate the information in the videos but more visually. The unit that covered data security and encryption is a good example of combining the videos and articles, and they definitely helped me understand public and private keys more. | Their practices are also pretty quick and straightforward if you are looking for extra resources other than the quizzes and practice tests. I used the practice tests about the internet because that was something I was not understanding just from Collegeboard practice. | . | THE EXAM . PAY ATTENTION TO THE QUESTIONS ON THE PRACTICE TESTS! The questions are very similar to what is on the exam. If you know them from the practice exam then you can save up on time from checking your work after you finish. | STARTING TIMING YOUR PRACTICE TESTS! The ones we were given in class were 50 questions. Once you get the hang of the first couple of practice tests, start giving yourself around a hour or an hour and a half to finish all 50 questions. This is gonna help you with pacing and with working under the pressure. | TAKE YOUR TIME! The test is 2 hours for 70 MC. You have time to double and even triple check your answers if you work at a good pace. With that being said don’t stress about not having enough time because you definitely do. | CREATE TASK TIPS . READ OVER THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY! Make sure that you are including each specific element in your project. It might be helpful to make a checklist with everything and check each item off as you are completing it with your project. I found myself having to review the guidelines a lot because there would be little things that I was forgetting, but doing so definitely made my project stronger. | REVIEW THE PAST EXAMPLES FROM COLLEGEBOARD! Seeing what ideas got lower scores guided me and I knew what to avoid including in my own project. Additionally, the good examples gave me some ideas of how other people included the required lists, iteration, and other items in a creative way. Though these examples might inspire you, make sure that you are coming up with your own idea and not directly copying. I looked at example A and B because those examples got all the points rewarded, so I looked at those for what to include and how much to write for my response. | I looked specifically at examples I and H because they both lost a bunch of points, so I made sure not look at what they did wrong and fix those error in my response. | . | CITE YOUR SOURCES! If you use code from somewhere else, dont forget to make notes throughout giving credit to the original creator. Even something as small as a loop needs to be cited if its from somewhere else. But definitely try to code everything yourself because it’s good practice and you learn a lot through actually working through the bugs in your project. | DON’T MAKE A BASIC GAME! This one is more subjective, but a lot of people were telling me that if you make something basic/generic like hangman or tic tac toe you are not going to get a good score. I think just try to be as creative as possible and make sure that your project has a geniune purpose because that’s an important part of the create task. Also please don’t do a GPA Calculator, its so overdone :) | REVIEW THE SCORING GUIDELINES! Don’t just assume you are meeting each requirement, check the guidelines. They let you know exactly what they are looking for, so its another great way to double check your work. | CODE IT ALL AT ONCE THEN REVIEW EACH SECTION! This is also more subjective, but I found it super helpful to code a basic idea of what my create task would look like and all the functionality in one sitting. Then as the deadline approached, I spent a day working through each sections, adding new functionality that reflected the requirements, and refining the code I already created to be more effcient. This was more helpful for me because I had way more time to refine the code and make it way better than that initial draft. | ADD COMMENTS TO THE CODE AS YOU GO! This is something that I wish I did because I ended up forgetting until the last days before the submission. It was not fun having to organize my code and add comments to each line right before the deadline. Adding comments to each section after you write the code is definitely ideal because you can remember exactly what the purpose is. | SPEND A DAY REARRANGING THE CODE! This was important for me because the order that my code was in only made sense to me. But obviously I’m not the one grading, so I spent time going through and arranging my code in a way that I thought would make sense to a random person going through it line by line. | MY CREATE TASK PROCESS LINKS .

Each time we engage in Code/Code/Coding it is an opportunity to think of the possibility of fulfilling the Create Performance Task requirement. But, this is a student project and responsibility is on you. To be thinking and preparing is a mindset, one that Del Norte CompSci Teachers advise as we proceed through topics. Thus, we are getting and early start by using this Pair Share project as an iteration through the entire process, as that is the foundational principle behind PBL. . Teacher will help as directed by College Board… . Provide instruction, practice, and feedback related to content and skills that will help students succeed on the performance task. This can include, but needs not be limited to, the iterative development process, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithm’s purpose and explaining how it functions. | Brainstorm problems that programming can address or brainstorm special interests that students want to incorporate when developing a program. | Assist students in defining their focus and choice of topics without making selections for them (e.g., by asking questions). | Review the performance task directions and provide multiple opportunities to practice and discuss the entire performance task and individual prompts of the task. | Explain the role the teacher can and cannot play in providing students with assistance during the actual performance task; teachers should encourage students to take advantage of the opportunity to get assistance and feedback from teachers and peers during practice. | Review the scoring guidelines with students to help them understand how their work will be assessed. Teachers should remind students that the scoring guidelines align to the prompts in the performance task, so they must respond to all the prompts in their attempt to obtain the highest score possible. | . Disclaimer. Del Norte Computer Science Teachers are not experts in College Board scoring guidelines. It is best to look for examples of performance task submissions at high, medium, and low levels on College Board Web Site. Any grades you receive on any project in class may differ from scoring of the performance task by College Board. . General Requirements, from CB Exam Description . Prior to the official administration of the Create performance task, students need practice implementing programs that first include sequencing, then incorporate selection and iteration, and finally use procedures and lists. While collaboration on ideation and program design and development during the Create performance task is not required, it is encouraged. . You will be provided with a minimum of 12 hours of class time to complete and submit the following: . Final program code (created independently or collaboratively) | A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently) | Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently) | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers are requiring students to do collaborative ideation, program design, prototyping and pair programming on these early activities that we grade in class. . Create Performance Task Skills and Rubric Breakdown (Out of 6 Points) . Note: There is no partial credit (0 or 1 point for each section). AP Computer Science Principles Exam is a through-course performance task that assesses Computational Thinking Practices 1, 2, 3, and 4 across six rubric rows. . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Assesses students’ ability to explain how a code segment or program functions. (Skill: Code Analysis) | For 3a, make sure to differentiate between program purpose and function They are defined in the scoring guidelines | . | . Row 2: Data Abstraction .

Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . Assesses students’ ability to implement and apply an algorithm. (Skill Algorithms and Program Development) | . Row 6: Testing . Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context,or task. (Skill Computational Solution Design - testing) | . Collaboration Rules, from CB Q&amp;A . Collaboration happens when two or more students are actively engaged in the development of a program. Some examples of acceptable ways to collaborate are as follows. . 2 students who are writing the entire program together, perhaps using pair programming. | 2 or more students who have divided a larger, more complex program into different separate parts, each writing their own part and then assembling the pieces into the finished program. | Student(s) giving feedback on an independently or collaboratively written program. | Student(s) providing debugging assistance to another student or collaborative group of students. | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers want to see all of these prescribe methods of collaboration utilized. . Collaboration without Plagiarism, from CB Q&amp;A . If students are combining independently written program code with another student, they should cite that the program code is written by a collaborative peer. To protect the anonymity of the collaborative peer, students simply state that the portion of program code was written by their collaborative peer, rather than putting the names of themselves or their collaborative peer in the program code. . When completing the Create performance task, students will need to add substantial revisions and additional functionality when starting with preexisting program code. Simply changing an image in a game or the names of variables is insufficient. . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers have zero tolerance for plagiarism. Misrepresenting your own work and not attending class (without makeup) are the only ways to get less than 70% in the class. Plagiarism is 0%, being in class is 50%, any individual effort with attendance gets 70%. The biggest jeopardy to getting a bad grade in the class is getting a 0%, the only possibility of such is plagiarism or missing class without makeup. .

Everywhere you see an “include” this layout is including a fragment to complement the page, things like CSS, JavaScript, headers and footers are included into the layout.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",

            "title": "Fastpages Frontend Development - Tour of GitHub Pages",
            "content": "Tour of Fastpages . . GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpages is built on top of GitHub pages. Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you don’t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code. There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website... . _notebooks: jupyter .ipynb files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook. | _posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript. | _word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Goggle documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps. | . Read more or review files in the fastpages README.md . . Resources . There are many resources, tutorials, and reference for building pages with HTML and Markdown. On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it. Right clicking on Chrome provides View Page Source on any link on the Web. The APCSA/APCSP projects have many examples within these projects. Here are a couple of Web links I often find through google or refer to when looking for ideas … . HTML on W3Schools | Markdown Cheat Sheet | . Home Page . The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. GH Pages / Fastpages builds allows you to mix Markdown and HTML within the index.html file. . Sub Pages . Look under _pages folder within the Navigator. In this directory, there are several .md files. These allow a combination of HTML and Markdown. Observe that this project has prefix of 01, 02, 03 on the .md files allows control the order of menus from left to right… . 01_search.md: This provides a very cool search on the site. The search.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 02_tags.md: This provide a very cool tagging system that is related to the “categories: categoryname” that are seen at the top of all the GH Pages / Fastpages _posts. This tags.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 03_about.md: This page is left for your individual customization, similar to index.html | Developers can add .md file of choice and order according to preference. | . Images . Look under images folder and you will see files added to support the site. Some are for customization of the site others are for pages. . Site: favicon.ico, logo.png | Pages: agile.webp, apcsp.png | . GH Pages YAML files . The _config.yml has many strings and preferences that are specific to the site. The file is full of comments that describe what can be changed and what should remain untouched. Note, the .yml files will be seen again as we begin to deploy our own site with Docker. . Hacks . Personalize index.html file and build your own Fastpages / GH Pages for personal use throughout the year. . Add _pages/notes.md or _pages/vocab.md, insert between tags.md and about.md. Use this area to capture idea and terms throughout the year. | Add some personal study or work pages. Consider how you will use these in conjunction with notes/vocab pages, search, and tagging. Publish _notebook file | Publish _post file with image | Publish _docx file from Google Doc source | . | . Extra Credit . Consider re-designing and using your home page for this class and for other subjects, other than Computer Science. The searching and tagging features are very powerful and could help recall notes from any class. .",

Env, Git and GitHub . Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env . cd $project echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;show the secrets of .git&quot; cd .git ls -l echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;look at config file&quot; cat config . Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | .

            "content": "Anthony: Computer Science Before APCSA . Hello! My name is Anthony Vo, and I graduated Del Norte with the class of 2022. . My computer science journey started when I was in second grade. Khan Academy used to have a coding portion of its website, and I remember spending hours making programs that drew simple images. There was no logic involved in the coding, but as an introduction, it got me hooked on the subject. Here&#39;s a recreation of a pig that I made using Khan Academy: . . In elementary school, I used Scratch to create a plethora of games. During the summer, I also took ID Tech Camps that taught me more about game design and programming. Though some of these camps weren&#39;t that helpful in learning computer science (Minecraft mapping isn&#39;t a skill I use to day), they furthered my interest in the subject. You can check out some of my scratch projects here. . I took more computer science classes in middle school with the two GTT classes. The classes still worked a lot with Scratch, but in 8th grade, I learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Those classes didn&#39;t result in the best programs, but it provided a solid foundation for problem solving and syntax that I continue to build off of today. Below are a few programs that I made in eighth grade (updated to conform to modern Python standards). . &quot;&quot;&quot;Anthony Vo 11-14-17 coinflip.py To practice using random numbers&quot;&quot;&quot; #Imports random module import random #Initializes variables numberOfHeads = 0 numberOfTails = 0 #Flips coins for number in range(20): coinSide = random.randrange(2) if coinSide == 0: numberOfHeads = numberOfHeads + 1 print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: numberOfTails = numberOfTails + 1 print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Gives result print(f&quot;Overall, heads was flipped {numberOfHeads} times while tails was flipped {numberOfTails} times.&quot;) . Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Heads Heads Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Heads Heads Tails Heads Tails Overall, heads was flipped 5 times while tails was flipped 15 times. . &quot;&quot;&quot;Anthony Vo 11-14-17 fortunecookies.py To practice using random numbers&quot;&quot;&quot; #Imports random module import random #Gives messages whichMessage = random.randrange(5) if whichMessage == 0: print(&quot;You will soon have indigestion due to that fortune cookie.&quot;) elif whichMessage == 1: print(&quot;You will buy more Kung Pao Chicken in the future.&quot;) elif whichMessage == 2: print(&quot;Following this retaurant&#39;s Facebook page will make you prosperous.&quot;) elif whichMessage == 3: print(&quot;If you go to that fake Chinese restaurant Panda Express, you will become poor.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Not eating Chinese cuisine will cause you to have many unlucky days.&quot;) . Following this retaurant&#39;s Facebook page will make you prosperous. . The next computer science class that I took was Mr. Mortensen&#39;s Intro to Computer Science class (which has since been replaced with CSP). This was probably my favorite class in all of high school; hanging out in fifth period with my friends, coding, and having an overall good time was one of the highlights of high school... which probably says something about me ;). I learned how to use GitHub in this class and really collaborate with my peers, which helped me apply my skills to a practical environment. I also learned C which helped me understand more about how computers processed code. Below is a program I made which creates random questions. You can see how much better my programming got after taking this class! . // // main.c // parameterFunctionQuestion(s) // // Created by Vo, Anthony on 9/11/19. // Copyright © 2019 Vo, Anthony.

Anthony: My AP CSA Experience . Finally, we&#39;ve reached junior year. I took AP CSA during the quarantine year, and it helped me improve my Object Oriented Programming skills by a lot. My success in the class stemmed mostly from motivation to code; I spent my first periods coding instead of playing Roblox (which was a popular alternative that I did in my English classes), and I made sure to finish all of my assignments on time without copying from others. Mr. Mortensen&#39;s AP study plan also helped a lot. We were required to finish a CollegeBoard unit quiz every week, so I would hop in a Discord call with my group members every Friday to do the quiz together. I have a lot of fond memories of staying up until 2 AM with my friends on Friday to meet Mr. Mortensen&#39;s assignment deadline (admittedly, it was a lot more fun than it sounds). . For success in AP CSA, I would recommend completing everything on time. Though there is a grace period for a lot of assignments, if you fall behind one week and don&#39;t understand a concept, it can quickly snowball out of control. Get on top of your assignments, make sure you understand each week&#39;s concepts, and you&#39;ll succeed. You don&#39;t need to have had years of prior experience like me; you just need to try your best to understand and work on each week&#39;s work. . After junior year, I realized that I had a big hole in my repretoire. I could code well, sure, but I couldn&#39;t actually present or make anything of substance. So, as I chose senior classes, I decided on CSP to work on my web development skills. I spent the summer writing college essays, playing League of Legends, and hanging out. I also found out that I got a 5 on the AP CSA exam! When fall came, I was ready to begin creating polished websites. During that first trimester, I met a new friend... . Sahil: Starting Out . Hey, I&#39;m Sahil Samar. I&#39;m currently a senior at Del Norte, in the graduating class of 2023. . My computer science journey started out in around 8th grade when I got interested in game development. But game development was a super hard thing to start with! Unity uses a language called C#, and I didn&#39;t have any idea how to use it. I didn&#39;t really understand the architecture of Unity or C# at first; I just kind of dove in and started making projects. I would look up what I didn&#39;t know, and just copy paste in code to get things working. Even this was hard, because when something went wrong I had no idea how to fix it. But with way too many hours, I was able to make some projects. It isn&#39;t easy to get started getting into coding! By the time I got to AP CSP, I still had a lot to learn about the coding mindset. . My very first game, 3D Pong: . . Sahil: AP CSP . When I got to AP CSP, I still didn&#39;t really have an idea of how coding worked. I just knew how to find code and paste it into my project. But slowly, I began moving away from this. I met Anthony Vo, who you just read a little bit about, in my first trimester. Whenever I didn&#39;t understand something, he would always help me out. He wouldn&#39;t give me code to copy paste though. He would actually explain the code to me, so I could do it myself. This was huge for me, since I actually began to think about my code and be able to develop things on my own. Mr. Mortensen guided me through countless problems, but everytime I asked him for help I walked away with some new understanding of how to debug my code. At the start of the trimester, I would go up to Mr. Mortensen or Anthony as soon as I had a problem. But by the end of the year, I only used them as a last resort, after I had truly tried everything. At that point, I just needed a pair of fresh eyes, and not someone to guide me through the whole process. Moral of the story: you aren&#39;t expected to come in an expert at coding! But, if you use your resources properly, you can use this year to grow. You can develop the mindset of a programmer and learn how to create cool projects and debug your issues when things don&#39;t work out. . Sahil: After AP CSP . AP CSP shaped me to be the coder I am today; but you only get out of it what you put into it. If you work hard, then it can completely change your mindset (if you are a new coder), and teach you plenty of skills. After AP CSP, I was able to land a summer internship working in CS at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. During this internship, I worked with huge supercomputers and began to understand what servers really were and how they worked. Our project was called ICICLE. If you want to learn more about it, you could watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFk5tDTtoU. I developed sophisticated authentication methods, and did a lot of &quot;firsts&quot; in the project. I went from having to be guided through basic code in CSP to creating things that had never been done before. It&#39;s possible! After doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes, we got to test our system on massive knowledge graphs and run some machine learning algorithms. . Picture of one of the computers I worked with, called Expanse: . . Knowledge Graph of Asteroids, classified using a neural network on being hazarous or not: . . I also never gave up on making games! But now, I don&#39;t really need to follow tutorials anymore. I can architect a solution on my own, and when I do need to look something up I learn from it and implement it rather than just copying it. When something goes wrong, I&#39;m not stuck; I know what to do, and I have confidence because I know that every problem has a solution. Here&#39;s a peek at one of the games I&#39;m working on now: . . Anthony: After CSP . AP CSP helped immensely with my presentation and web development skills. For reference, here&#39;s a website I made for my 10th grade AP European History Final... . . As you can see, it looks like garbage! You can also check out my extremely great 11th grade website for AP CSA here. . After taking AP CSP, my websites looked a lot better. I updated a website for my golf coach and made some personal websites. Here&#39;s a quick one that I made to create basketball teams: . . Even if you&#39;re new to CS as a whole, knowing how to make websites can help you show off the things you&#39;ve done. Whether it&#39;s a personal portfolio website, an online shop, or anything else, web development is a great skill to have. . Final Thoughts . Anthony: I hope you have a great year in this class! If you put in the time and effort, you will be really successful and gain skills that you can use for the rest of your life. Best of luck to you all! . Sahil: .",

            "content": "Hello, World! . These examples show the basic language structures and constructs of Python using print and input commands (aka anatomy). . Print command using Static Text which performs output . The classic introduction to a programming language is to output a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. In Python, this is a print statement. . The command or function is print() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the print command. | The print command outputs the parameter to the terminal, as you see it in this Jupyter document | Output in Jupyter Notebook is below the code cell. Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically outputs to a terminal, we will see that when students start using Visual Studio Code. | . print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) . Dynamic example showing variables, input and output . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example takes input from the user and stores the input into a variable called msg (short for message), then outputs the msg to terminal. - This example is Dynamic as the input and output can change each time the code is run. . A variable &quot;msg&quot; is part of both statement The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used to capture the input command | The variable &quot;msg&quot; is then used as a parameter to print command, causing input to be output to terminal, or in Jupyter Notebook below the code cell. | . | The &quot;input&quot; command activates the jupyter notebook input box, which obtains input from the user (try it!) the &quot;msg&quot; variable is the dynamic result of the input command | . | The print command outputs the &quot;msg&quot; variable captured in the input statement note, msg is a parameter to the print function | . | Input and Output in Jupyter Notebook Input is NOT in line with Output, this is a little annoyance and requires familiarity. Input and Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically obtains input and outputs to a terminal, students will see that when they run Python programs using Visual Studio Code. | . msg = input(&quot;Enter a greeting: &quot;) print(msg) . Building a Function . This example adds to the basics of the Python anatomy, a function. Input, output, and grouping commands in functions is the key to most programming languages. This example simulates a free response answer to a question. . The &quot;def question_and_answer(prompt)&quot; now contains multiple indented commands, the commands print and input were learned previously. | Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Procedure, Function, def are all synonyms in the Python language. | The &quot;def&quot; is a key word in Python that defines a function. Using this keyword defines a group of commands, but does not run them initially. | The name of the function in this example is &quot;question_and_answer&quot;. In essence, we are defining our own command within the Python language. | The three &quot;question_and_answer&quot; commands that follow the function and indented commands allow this function to be run. | This code of the function is then run multiple times, each command line providing a unique &quot;prompt&quot; as a result of the literal parameter passed to the function. | The function takes a parameter called &quot;prompt&quot;, which is a message output to the user to describe the input requested. | String concatenation &quot;+&quot; prefixes the prompt with the literal message &quot;Question: &quot;. | The &quot;msg&quot; variable is captured as a result of the jupyter notebook input supplied by the user | The input &quot;msg&quot; is output back to the user with &quot;Answer: &quot; concatenated to the front. | . def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) question_and_answer(&quot;Name the Python output command mentioned in this lesson?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;If you see many lines of code in order, what would College Board call it?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Describe a keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;) . Imports, Selection, and Logical Expressions . In Python anatomy of you will be importing libraries and functions. This is code that is developed by others. In this example we are importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of your existing system. Additionally, this example uses the custom function defined earlier in the Jupyter document. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import | . Next, this example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | . The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . import getpass, sys def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 3 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;import&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;if&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;expression&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) .

A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding. Add Jupyter Notebooks (computational documents) and you bridge Computer with Data Science. The beauty of Jupyter is that it creates a computational narrative, a document that allows code and data with visual analysis, hypothesis, and conjecture. .

Visual Studio Code claims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug and version control cycle. It provides a Market Place for enhancements and more complex workflows. Before adding extensions, clone projects and see what is requested or added. Here are some extension that were added through that process or that I have added... . In marketplace there are several extensions for Python, Python Intellisense, Python Extension Pack | Jupyter: This supports build jupyter ipynb files from within VS Code | Code Spell Checker: Got to have it when building documents, particularly if you spell and typo like the Teacher | IntelliCode: Got to have it when creating a code file, it will sense type of code by extension. Also, it help with syntax as you are coding. | . Review Details in Marketplace for better explanation of purpose of the things explained above. There is a lot more! As you need Git help look at things like Git History and GitLens. Or, perhaps you enjoy Vim and want Vim emulation for editing, their is an extension for that.

            "title": "College Board Pseudo Code",
            "content": "Learning College Board Pseudo Code . Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. College Board has designed a pseudo code, non operational programming language, to highlight concepts that it wants every student to learn. College Board pseudo code highlights instructions that are common for many languages. . BTW, instructions are translated into machine code for computers to execute. The notation we look at is supposed to be easy for the user and their application. For instance, many new languages are being popularized around data science. It is more important that a Data Scientist is successful in their task, than to learn syntax that is not familiar to their traditional workspace. . College Board is trying to remain neutral and build Computer Science Principles off of any language, thus the Teacher is left to pick the language(s) according to application and curriculum. . Exam Reference Sheet . Comparison of CB Pseudo Code to Python with descriptions . Command Vocabulary | Pseudo code | Python | Purpose | . Output | DISPLAY(expression) | print(expression, end=” “) | Displays the value of expression, followed by a space. Python defaults to newline, thus the end=” “ | . Input | a ← INPUT() | a = input(prompt) | Accepts a value from the user and returns it to the variable a. | . Assignment | a ← expression | a = expression | Evaluates expression and assigns the result to the variable a. | . Selection | IF (expression) | if expression: | Run commands in the code block associated with the selection | . Iteration n times | REPEAT n TIMES | for i in range(n): | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration n times | . Iteration expression | REPEAT UNTIL (expression) | while expression: | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration while expression is true | . List Assignment | list ← [expression1, expression2, expression3] | list = [expression1, expression2, expression3] | Assigns 3 values to list, value can be literal or expressions | . First index in List | list[1] | list[0] | Access the 1st element in the list[]. FYI, most programming languages start a zero. | . Last index in List | list[LENGTH(list)] | list[len(list) - 1] | Access the last element in the list[]. If you start at zero, last element is length - 1. | . Define Procedure | PROCEDURE name (parameter) | def name(parameter): | Create a procedure containing a sequence of programming instructions. | . Expression equals | a = b | a == b | Evaluate if assigned value of a equals assigned value of b | .

Python IF Code Block using indent . a = 1 b = 1 if (a == b): # Python uses indent to establish code block, Teacher use tab key print(&quot;A equals B&quot;) . Suggestions for students . It is very important that you become fluent in “Command Vocabulary” and “Purpose” of the Pseudo Code versus Python comparison. During the year you will look at JavaScript which has same Command Vocabulary and Purpose. Others may take Java, you will see the same ideas again. . Start building Vocabulary and Purpose by Code/Code/Coding | Supplement you Code with comments and outputs using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. This style allows you to code explore and learn as you go. | Use CB pseudo code as part of your definitions as you build your notebooks. | . Hacks .

            "content": "Computer Science Principles Code.org . Monday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . . Code.org is sponsor. Lesson are from published Curriculum Guide. . Introduction is on equity. 50% girls in school should mean 50% enrollment in CSP | Follow up dates. Saturdays 10/15, 11/19, 1/28, 3/18 | Met Ken Toma (Canyon Hills, SD), Faith Yeaton (San Gabriel Academy, Pasadena area), Ms O&#39;Masters (Central Valley) | Worked with Sean Yeung who is new to my school :). I would like to see a lot of him this week. | Lesson 3 Plan What are 3 things you notice about the lesson plan? Circle and square patterns is a lite intro into binary. Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, which are leading to 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s that students will see in future. Group work is used, as one Teacher said in our session... &quot;to make sure the work gets done&quot;. | What are 2 things you have questions about? I believe 15-18 age group should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time listed for this lesson plan (45 minutes). Elaboration on this would seem like a fall back for me for the few in my school that don&#39;t get binary directly. IMO, binary should be taught in detail when needed, my plan is to teach it through color codes and through binary calculator; the later inspired by Harvard CS50. IMO, in modern languages and frameworks we don&#39;t want to lead students down the binary grind until they get interested in CS or binary as part of an application solution. College Board seems to have delayed this to Big Idea 2 and teaches concepts around data abstraction and data compression. | What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson? Since we are starting in a lesson, I would like to see 12 weeks or course vision. I feel like this is a very isolated and simple topic. Though, it is an easy thing for Teachers to get to know each other. Perhaps, for our event it is more about Collaboration from Big Idea 1 then Binary in Big Idea 2. | . | . . Monday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Binary Number System slide #99. The activity requires paper and Teacher thinks analog experience is important. Connect Circle-0 / Square-1. Teacher recognizes different experience level but thinks everyone should create flippy-do. Code.org vocabulary is last, but not to be ignored. . Relation is focussed on these concepts 0-9 are symbols for numbers in Base 10 | 0-1 are symbols for numbers in Base 2 | . | Make an adaptation to support Flippy-Do information: Binary Calculator | The 2048 game might be interesting development activity to relate to binary. | This is a general slide on all lessons slide #121. | Color Codes inserted into these lessons seems key to me, or some other purposeful element, encryption was mentioned by Teacher. In general, not seeing “why?” in Code.org lessons as we start… but the appear in the high level description. | . Compare Unplugged and Plugged Lessons. . What is teacher doing in unplugged lesson? encouragement, walking around, answering questions. Unplugged is not computer: Stand-up meeting, White Board Design | Let them Explore!!! Shared an idea of plugged lesson, shared a tool. Don’t lecture about it, as them what it does, what is happening? | . Teachers role is described as Lead learner. We may not know, but we can figure it out. My response to questions… . Lead learner allows diverse activities in classroom | Lead learner may provide completely different work for student with special interests or special needs. | Teacher (Jennifer) suggested she needs to build the computer science muscle, including suffer confusion. Student (Patrick) mentioned that students see straight into your capability. | Different rhythms for different students. | Blogging Platforms mentioned | Peer Feedback mentioned | Pair Programming mentioned | . Actions for inclusive classroom culture . Group thought it is more on capability versus culture | Student (Sonya) talked about doing multiple media types (paper, digital) | Student (Patrick) discussed audio and video slides for virtual | Student (Ken Toma) give everybody a voice. Suggested pair-share can provide that platform | . Async work . This video discusses a lot of what I believe in and will kickoff PBL well. I think it popped up by accident but it was cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s29LKfEFjQ | Watched the place, mostly it has a place to complete async activities and surveys. It says I am not enrolled when I attempt survey. | The Place introduced. | . Tuesday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Module 2 Intro Slides . USC represented shared Web Site | Unit 1 Lesson 7. Played with B/W Widget, on building black and white images. Idea was good on 1st couple of exercises, it quickly seemed to become tedious. I am not sure how it would related to key concepts in CB and not happy with it in PBL (except if we add improvement or design elements). Interaction could be improved to maintain orientation of Hexadecimal to lines. Maybe coding improvement could be to preserve orientation and allow clicking on pic, binary, or both. This exercise in driver navigator would make a lot of sense. Worked with Jp Fletcher, Jason Mahoney, Manuel Hernandez | Unit 1 Lesson 8. Color Images Widget, I like this for the 1st lesson more. It seems like the stair step is not significant and perhaps this might provide more joy. Somewhat a combination of two lessons would make me happier, perhaps one black/white and then color would be good for interactive lecture.

Learning objectives and essential knowledge. | Async was on Big Ideas, Computational Thinking practices,… In my experience I focus in on covering the Big Ideas. Students don’t seem to relate will to other weightings. Also, I focus on CTE principle of College Ready through test and Intern ready through PBL. If we teach them to build stuff a lot of the other things fall out. | . Tuesday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Kickoff was reviewing scavenger hunt. People generally have questions as new teachers. . Teacher (Katie) reviewed CB outline. My experience is by doing CB MCQs and PBL, the students think questions are easy/basic. | Next (Katie) covered the Code.org outline. Unit 1-3 cover Big Idea topics in 1, 2, 4. Units 4-7 cover Big Idea 3. | Some discussion on block coding vs scripted in Create Task Project. | . Transition to Unit 1 Lesson 9-10 Lossless/Lossy Compression. Widget Bubble 1 . Played with Text to Symbol compression, Ken Toma came up with multiple words. | Spoke on introduction, we instructed Patrick to look for associations to make this interesting. | Lossy compression had a reduction widget | Lossy compression had a pick quality slide voting | Summary on these, widgets and ideas are great for intro, but they don’t seem to have depth that I like in the lesson. I want people to learn how to do these. | . Async session had a video that shared review of things we missed in workshop versus code.org curriculum. This filled some gaps that I thought were missing in order that we followed. . How you interact with the World. | For tomorrow, there is talk of Internet Simulator / Messaging System that may be good illustration and complement to a Tech Talk. I wonder, do they provide code for these tools? That would be a great thing to teach students to make, it looks like it works over sockets because of instant refresh. | . Wednesday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Internet Unit A new day of slides . Paseo Reflection . Strongly: identify Coach, Parent | Life Advantage: Being Chinese, Entrepreneur | Equity: Teacher, Coach/Teaching | Feel, Identity: Balance on sharing (ego heavy, selling short). Mental health and physical health are important on reflection, feeling selfish. Give people benefit in process of their evaluation. | . Network Challenge. This is the challenge that was familiar to classroom and Colin made this as an app a couple of years ago. . Two people share a line | Multiple connections from persons to lines | Teachers are holding a lot of stock in simplicity and activity. Though, Network are multiply connected to routers and not computers and Network design is complex. It should be clarified that most home computers have a single router. A,B,C,D,E should be conceptual. ISP typically have multiple paths and home networks do not. It is interesting that Group 4 used a hub, challenge #3; this tells me that people are going to think it is computers. | . IP Addresses and DNS. Started by making a series of appointments. Not much purpose of this other than addressing names and getting a response. Creating a packet of data (Monday, Cheanie) response (OK). . Async work . Mental pictures Blind spots, accept you have them and work on them. Female: delicate, caring family | Male: career, strong, powerful | . | Article summary is holding ourself accountable for bias, as I am sure I have some bias that is reflected in my work. However, I believe most of my personal bias has to do with classroom behavior of the individual. Other notes: sometimes students are looking for bias | Difficulty: those that have history (good or bad) in a year long classroom have difficult going good to bad or bad to good in my eyes. Certainly someone who starts great gets a lot of my respect and favoritism. | . | Digital information dilemmas, game companies can’t use Lebron James tattoos. There is so much copyright, I am not even sure I can take notes and represent pictures, but I do it. | . Wednesday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Network Simulator and Bias . Network Simulator would be really fun if code was available. I think I would like to mimic it for a development project. Students really resonate toward building this type of thing. It could be built on top of Logging and Image thing. | Bias discussion and my problems exists or are established on behavior. I have favorite students and even invite them into Nighthawk Coding Society. Or they invite themselves. | Student attitude may have something that needs exploration. | . Async work is mostly a couple of videos and ability to comment on the material. These are particularly good ideas and are somewhat built into GitHub pages. . We should have students comment on most of the lessons or the day after the lessons. This could be a great way to obtains some feedback in context. | Network simulator may be a tool that we could build in class, it would be an interesting project for a team that wants to code. | . After hours work. Because of discussion of awarding people on doing things conversation, plus many asking questions about how to score on doing things… I went back and updated hacks and worked with Sean on getting comments working on Tools Setup. IMO, this solves problem of presenting, providing what to do, and capturing in the same place. . Thursday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Who Belongs in CSP? Thursday Slides . Unit 3 Bridge to programming units starting with Lesson 2 Design Mode, student work in AppLab | Stocks, has several rows and columns. It show a graph and has current price. If you click on a stock it takes you to articles written about the stock | . MSFT /graph 274.17 AAPL /graph 155.98 . Block coding tool is big focus. Pace is slow. | Design session introduced JavaScript commands. It showed onEvent with a function. There is kind of a confusing design and tool back and forth, mostly presenter and online issues. | . Async very quick example that seems to beg for me to say yes to intervention. But IMO, there are bigger fish to fry than someone knowing a stats answer. . BTW, we saw many mistakes presented in Networking lines game, but people were not speaking up. Sometimes it is best to let people just have an answer. | Debugging was topic in video. Positive “make mistakes message”, goes with grading comment made to have check boxes for points, not right or wrong. Learning is a process, everything does not need ot be corrected. | . Planning notes for an Application like the Birds sample, mostly use their code with minor adaptations… . - Stock Quiz - Start Screen Begin Button — 1 — What is most valuable stock on US exchanges? Apple (AAPL) and three wrong — 2 — What is Robin Hood darling stock in 21-22? Game Stop and three wrong — 3 — What is a good philosophy in market? Buy low Sell high and three wrong — Winner Screen — Congrats. Here are some tips before you go invest… Open, Close, Day High/Low, 52 week average — Wrong Answer Screen — Try again, wrong answer. You must get the right answer to continue (move on). . Thursday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Lab work. Best link for AppLab. My biggest observation was not about the lessons, it was about the cohorts and their Lab work. Many of them were with very excited about their creations. AppLab made some successful and really picked up their excitement. I think Wednesday was a downer for me and perhaps a lot of others and it carried with me into Thu. Today many spirits were lifted. . IMO, Tech success lifts spirits | Teacher cohorts like to see that they coded. AppLab example on QA’s seems to be very intuitive for new coders. I know students like a Quiz and they can lead into Data Analytics, so it is not a bad thing. | I was helping someone that was very new (Patrick) and he seemed to have some intuition about things like Label, Text Box, Button. | Less intuition on Sequencing and Events. Perhaps their should be a little intro to these structures, like placing code inside of events. Also, my view was a little difficult so it was difficult to be a great Pair Programmer as I should have caught some extra clicks in producing excess code. | Finally, Pair Programming is an interactive two brain process. It was weird to hear facilitator talk about Driver/Navigator as if Navigator is more in command position. | . Friday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Saturday Oct 15, Dec 3, Jan 28, Mar 18 workshop days. . Equity in CompSci Classroom. Sindie talked about zero experience, not only the smart student. . Work load. (Asian, 50% Indian) Mental health is a bigger focus for this year (work load management, more in class work, but lots of information at the beginning of year) | Sonya parent pressure, grade 1st (Korean) Debugging the Gender Gap (video), “what does a coder look like?”. | Jason variety not just group work (Hispanic) | Patrick email: Patrick.davis@inglewoodusd.com | . Assessment changes . Here is instructors percentage guide | Many seem to NOT have a system for this as they don’t have a vision of what they will teach yet. | . CTE/Admin Report with focus on Pathway . Regarding CompSci Pathway, there are no standards. Districts and even schools pick. . My understanding is Districts pick their Curriculum Provider and it often requires Teachers to get a certificate. Code.org is fulfilling district/certificate requirements. Code.org is providing a completely closed platform with its own LMS and tools. | USC and UCSD attachments to Code.org are both using an ncsu.org. NC State system to aggregate teacher completion, for example async work must be captured in the tool. My thoughts are USC, UCSD, NC State are involved in some sort of grant program as an individual pops in and promotes on campus events and opportunities for teacher to get certificate that will help boost pay. There was a USC off campus host managing the class, they are giving Teachers some swag and hours toward certificate. Teachers at training had little and mostly no CompSci experience. | . CS Discovery is a Code.org brand. According to PLTW web site their brand is Essentials. . College Board Lists Curriculum Providers | From Code.org What is CS Discoveries CS Discoveries is designed to fit naturally between our CS Fundamentals courses and our CS Principles course | Computer Science Discoveries is an introductory computer science course for 6 - 10th grade students. | . | From PLTW.org the name is CS Essentials This lists Essentials, Principles, A, Cybersecurity | Principles description has Cybersecurity emphasis | . | . Of course College Board is another business which in turn is advertising groups like Code.org or PLTW.org. However, the are also list Apple which is listed as a provider of curriculum for CompSci Principles. This is kind of fun for me, as it goes back to my Intro year, but this content can be used for CS Principles. Develop in Swift AP CS Principles curriculum helps students build a foundation in programming using Swift—a powerful and intuitive open source programming language designed by Apple—while preparing them for the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. Students will get practical experience with the tools, techniques, and concepts needed to build an iOS app. They’ll learn about the impact of computing, privacy, and security on society, while exploring the technology behind their own activities through interactive stories. Develop in Swift AP CS Principles includes a student and teacher guide available for free on Apple Books. Downloadable Xcode and Playground project files are also available to support the curriculum activities . Back to CTE, the students and teacher. Teacher motivations can vary. My philosophy is teach content and test will fall out. Yesterday I had a Teacher in our breakout say to me… Bottom Line, I want all my students to get 100% on AP exam. End of story. But, I don&#39;t think the Code.org platform, the training I got, and me are going to make it happen. A Student was working with me yesterday and we were dialoguing on Slack. He was working with me on something wrt his internship that was related to certificate deltas between Windows and MacOS. I told the student about my Code.org training I don&#39;t really like the code.org method. My friend goes to a different school and took AP CSP using that curriculum. I personally was unimpressed with that I told the student that I was looking at a softer entrances into PBL I don&#39;t think code.org is the solution, coming from a student perspective. You might want to take a more traditional class approach by teaching everyday at the beginning, which is what students are used to. Then ease into PBL Also, yesterday I had several students working with me on next years classroom tooling. From this experience, all students had their own blogging and tooling platform. IMO, Student are the center. Thus, object should form around student. Not Code.org or LMS. This means they need their own tools and their own objects. This means an open platform to express their engineering . Summary. Sharpen the sword is a phrase used in habit of highly successful people. I learned a lot during the week from Code.org training and platform. Also, I got great exposure to many new teachers entering into Computer Science. I am happy that there is something for these people to grab onto. Also it helped me provide a lesson idea for Sean in our 3rd week (related to interest in block coding). But, for me this is a case of sharpening the sword, there is no intention to adopt the entire curriculum. I hope to continue with my existing approach to CSP curriculum: PBL, Open Platform. Sword sharpening includes: adding softer entries to topics, more traditional lectures in Trimester 1, build muscle for longer term PBL. .",

            "title": "Neo4J Graph Database Introduction",
            "content": "Introduction . CS-Students is a sample knowledge graph that can be used to model any classroom that is relation based (a classroom that has lots of different people, pairs, groups, periods; things like that). This notebook is meant to demonstrate how to query this knowledge graph based on the preset things that are currently in the sample data. . Data . Currently, the data consists of the following categories (which are labels in Neo4J): . Period (most teachers would find it useful to have their data divided into class periods) . Scrum Team (basically, the largest overarching groups of students, under period) . Pairs (pairs of students within scrum teams) . Person (object that represents each student) . The data also has the following relationships . IN_PERIOD (to relate teams to the period they are in) . CROSSOVER (a relationship that exists to connect pairs of teams which work together) . PAIR_SHARE (relationship defining students who are paired together) . IN_GROUP (to relate people to the group they are in) . Setup in Anaconda . 1: Install Anaconda . 2: On windows, open the Anaconda command prompt. On mac, open the normal terminal. . 3: Run the following commands: . conda install jupyter . conda install py2neo . conda install pandas . conda install neo4jupyter . 4: If you haven&#39;t already, then clone this repository to a location that you can navigate to easily in your files. . 5: The commands above have configured your conda environment. Now, simply run the command . jupyter notebook . 6: This should open up something in the browser. You will see all of your files. Navigate to the directory which has the github repository clone. . 7: Then, navigate to this notebook. You should be able to run this notebook and experience all of its features now! . Setup in an IDE like VSCode . 1: In the IDE terminal, run the following commands: . pip install jupyter . pip install py2neo . pip install pandas . pip install neo4jupyter . 2: You&#39;re all set to run the notebook! . import pandas as pd import getpass from py2neo import Graph, Node, Relationship from py2neo import GraphService import neo4jupyter neo4jupyter.init_notebook_mode() . # The password is made private. password = getpass.getpass(prompt=&#39;Password: &#39;, stream=None) graph = Graph(&quot;neo4j+ssc://f9708be2.databases.neo4j.io&quot;, auth=(&quot;neo4j&quot;, password)) # database gs = GraphService(&quot;neo4j+ssc://f9708be2.databases.neo4j.io&quot;, auth=(&quot;neo4j&quot;, password)) . neo4jupyter.draw(graph, {&quot;PERSON&quot;: &quot;name&quot;}) . query = &quot;MATCH(n:SCRUM_TEAM) RETURN n.name AS TeamName, n.runtimelink AS RuntimeLink&quot; graph.run(query).to_data_frame() . query = &quot;MATCH(n1:PERSON)-[rel:IN_GROUP]-&gt;(n2:SCRUM_TEAM {name: &quot;Team 1 &quot;}) RETURN n1.name AS Person, rel.Job AS Job&quot; graph.run(query).to_data_frame() . query = &quot;MATCH(n1:PERSON)-[rel:IN_GROUP]-&gt;(n2:SCRUM_TEAM {name: &quot;Team 2 &quot;}) RETURN n1.name AS Person, rel.Job AS Job&quot; graph.run(query).to_data_frame() . The following cells show how to do CRUD operations . You can do more than just query! To see your changes in effect, rerun the visualization in the third cell. . def CreatePerson(personName): tx = graph.begin() createdPerson = Node(&quot;PERSON&quot;, name = personName) tx.create(createdPerson) graph.commit(tx) def CreatePersonTester(): n = input(&quot;Enter a person name: &quot;) CreatePerson(n) # Run the CreatePersonTester function to try creating a node.

Move on to main focus: . Create an Apple App using Xcode and Swift AND/OR | Unity Game Development Curriculum | . Certificate Programs . Certificates are available online and at many avenues (Udemy, LinkedIN, Apple, etc). Teachers could/should learn and then perhaps teach courses that are aligned to certificates by an organization like LinkedIn. This would enable Teachers and District to confidently state that their Teachers are current to CTE advisors. . LinkedIn Certification Programs for Development Engineering Methodology .

In discussion on titles, it seems vital to a High School Pathway that it leads beyond. A key contributor to increasing Del Norte student participation in Computer Science, ~100 tto ~240, is the introduction of Computer Science Principles. . Computer Science Principles has AP testing and UC accreditation as a 3rd Science, not just elective. | Computer Science “A” has AP testing and UC accreditation as a 4th Math, not just elective. | Data Structure 1&amp;2 with B or above graded will articulate to CS113 Data Structures. There has been movement by Emily Stephenson, Del Norte and Mira Costa College regarding articulation. This begins with students taking CSP/DS1 in Fall of 2022, it completes with students finishing CSA/DSP2 in Summer of 2024, receiving credit for CS113 – Data Structures. | Beyond College, it seems the other “Big Thing” that High School Computer Science can do is to prepare students for internships and jobs. Del Norte has been placing people regularly at Northrop Grumman (2 per year), UCSD Supercomputer (2 per year), Code Ninjas (2 per year). Additionally, I have 2 reports of students Teaching in CompSci Labs on campus (Harvard and Mira Costa College). Lastly, I have heard of a Purdue freshmen that is currently getting a Government clearance for internship in Summer 2023. An absolute key is having projects published on GitHub! The Purdue freshmen said the internship interviewer said “they reviewed projects on GitHub and new that he could code”. These opportunities seem to come because of Agile Methodology, Scrum, Python/Flask, Java/Spring, AWS, SQL, Linux, Anaconda, Docker, Nginx, GitHub. | . CS 113: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms Units: 3 Prerequisites: CS 112. Acceptable for Credit: CSU, UC Lecture 2 hours, laboratory 3 hours. Course Typically Offered: Fall, Spring, and Summer . The course uses topics of personal and social relevance to investigate the impact of computing through efficient algorithms and properly designed data structures. Students explore the software development process by developing effective solutions using industry-standard tools. Topics include searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis, object-oriented design, collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs. C-ID COMP-132. | .

Frontend web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website through a Browser. In this class, we will be using Fastpages on top of GitHub Pages to maximize our presentations, while minimizing our front-end coding. GitHub Pages deployment is performed through Jekyll, which regenerates the website automatically after each commit, tracking can be seen in Actions tab within GitHub. | HTML generation is performed through Liquid, a template language (similar to Jinja2 or Thymeleaf). | CSS style layout is provided by using Themes provided through GH Pages. Each page we make we assume the defined theme and insert our HTML fragments, local page style, and local page JavaScript. | JavaScript enables pages to have actions, fetch content, animate, etc | . . . Code in this Sub Menu . HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the Web. Many tools and languages complement development using markup, style and JavaScript. This section of the Nighthawk Coders CS website is providing some code samples. These are intended to spark your own PBL ideas. Each of these were generated after watching others teach or interacting with students. . Tutorial: This page is a FastPages _post. This page contains Markdown and HTML. Pull this file into VSCode and explore the fundamentals of making a content page. | Calculator: This calculator was inspired by Mr. Mortensen’s calculator that he built in Objective-C during his first year of teaching at DNHS (2019). It was recreated by former student Anthony using Fastpages, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on this site in 2022. Creating a calculator helps developers to learn how to manage temporary data, manage presentation, associate input to calculator output, and work with logic | Visually it shows how math works within a language; specific functions, handling of strings, numbers, math, etc. | . | Binary: This example was created after watching Harvard CS50 by David J. Malan in 2020, he had built a machine to turn on and off lights/binary digits. My thought after watching machine, why not simulate that binary machine in software? Liquid is used to define a constant for the number of bits | JavaScript is used base 2, 8, 16 calculations | . | Grades: This grade calculator was created to show interaction of HTML and JavaScript to perform input. Additionally, it show how to add element to HTML Document Object Model (DOM). FYI, the IJavaScript kernel did not support input as of this writing. | Graph: This was created when a student named Bryant 2022 asked me the question “how would I plot data?” as described in an FRQ. JavaScript canvas is used to draw grid, axis, lines | . | Life: This was created by Nathaniel 2022 when I asked him about something interesting to show students in JS that relates to school. Built on Conway’s Game of Life (Wikipedia, Original) | Somewhat pure JavaScript, no canvas usage even though it has a grid. | . | Snake: This was interest of students in each of my 3 years, inspiration and some of the code came from a student named Nolan 2021. Contains menu and settings, as well as Grid | Uses JavaScript canvas and key events | . | .",

          "content": "| Overview | Covid19 RapidAPI | Jokes API | Users Database | User Login | . APIs in this Sub Menu . HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the API. Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Python RESTful API libraries. A Python List is used to make a Data Model, but persistence in this technique is limited, each time server is refreshed data is lost. This example is great for learning, but data is considered volatile. | Users: Another RESTful API library example. However, this backend establishes data persistence through the use of a database. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Python to define REST APIs. Python tools are very popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
